My hometown is in a close city from the place where Bitcoin City is going to be built, which is called La Union, and my father works exactly there. I currently live in the capital city San Salvador and had to move here six years ago due to work.   


**The concentration of development in San Salvador, the rest of the country in oblivion**

Well, you'll see, El Salvador is a very small country in territory but all the development is concentrated only and **only** in the capital city San Salvador and all the rest of the country has been abandoned basically since the country's foundation. That is one reason for my anger towards the old politicians and previous generations who did merely **nothing** to distribute richness and development equally along in the country and they forgot completely about all the other cities. As a result, logically all the young people has been migrating year after year to San Salvador, including me, who had to say good bye to our families and hometowns in order to get a better job to survive. And the thing is that those previous politicians forgot about the countryside and all the rest of the country due to corruption issues and lack of vision and lack of perspective. They weren't that smart, they weren't that savvy about the modern world, and this is an issue that still persists in our neighbor countries like Guatemala and Honduras. 

  
So for us, having development in an area that is not the capital city is a big, or a huge improvement. As I said when I started, this country is really small in territory, you can cross it entirely in just six ours! And it would be even less if our transportation system gets improved. In my hometown we have cultural differences in holidays, food, traditions, and beliefs, this is a very rich country when it's about culture, in fact, among the citizens, it feels like we have two countries inside: the west and the east. In the West we have San Miguel (my homecity) and La Union, which is known for being close to the sea. La Union is known for being really hot, tropical place, you have warm wind during summer and is perfect for going to the beach, which is like 15 minutes far. 

&amp;#x200B;

**We live in a bubble.**

When it's about the contact with foreigners, it is very uncommon thing for the average Salvadorian. Salvadorans usually see foreign people like people who do not like to visit us because we think ourselves that our country is so bad that no one wants to visit, and even less to live here. And many times we tend to question visitors about why they visit us if they could be ""better"" in their countries. It has happened many times. I've met people from all around the globe here, from China, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, France, Colombia, the US, Russia, Egypt, Mexico, Sweden, etc. Some of them have years living here that they got to become residents and all of them have told me that at some point they get asked ""what are you doing here?"" meaning ""you could get back to live better in Sweden (or any country where you lived before)"", but they also tell me that Salvadorans are highly friendly with them, gain confidence and trust really fast, they are warm and welcoming and overall very human. Salvadorans help you if you're in problem, even if they don't know who you are, they talk to you and try to make friends very fast, so once you get into their circle they'll teach you everything you need to know.

But there is something else that I want to mention. This is nothing new in the world tho, we also have it. Many foreigners here in El Salvador live in separated areas, it is not seen like that but yeah, in fact, there are residential building where no regular Salvadorans have access (just th eeople who work in cleaning and maintenance stuff). Those foreigners may have another version of El Salvador, another very different where they don't get much contact with locals, and have no touch of how is our culture and our average day to day reality. These residential areas have been accommodated to provide all their needs and there is no need for them to go out. In the present days still more of there residential areas are being built, there is even one huge building in  La Escalon, in Sal Salvador, which is an area known for being built for rich people to live in. But in the recent years this rich people have been moving to another area called Santa Elena, and the La Escalon is being left for regular people little by little. If Bitcoin City is going to be like this, it's ok I think, because we already have areas like that, but as a Salvadoran, my wish is to have development in the whole country and not only for a little bunch of people like it was in the past. And we already know about that. Fortunately we've seen it's not going to be the case.   


**Gangs. Buses and transport.** 

There used to be gangs at my city when I lived there. I was robbed in a bus six times, they robbed me my phone and money. And around my house around two people a year used to be murdered. I saw death people and blood. As a local, they do nothing to you because they know you. Gangsters are the same people who used to be our friends in school, but one day they joined the gang because they had no money, no job, no opportunities and weren't able to leave the country (remember when I told you in the beginning that the whole country was forgotten with no development and nothing else than misery). They manage to survive, unfortunately in the wrong way. I remember the day I decided I ws going to fight for my life, but not in that way! I decided to never enter a gang, I decided that I was going to be different. So how have we reduced gang activity in the last two years? 1. the government is giving opportunities to young people (I myself was in a help program, learning how to put my own business). 2. The government cut the economic help that previous corrupt governments gave to them. 3. The police force was heavily increased and supported them with new equipment and improved salaries 

Also, young people now have different facilities where they can learn about technology, or another areas like making food, learn languages, and leverage other skills. Nowadays there are no murders in my home city and fortunately we don't have to think much about that. 

About transportation, it has been a huge, huge issue all our life. Basically the owners of the transportation system are also a corrupt group who have the monopoly of transportation and have a horrible transportation system. That is the reason why the best way to go to another side of the city is to have a car. The current government has announced to be working in extreme measures to eradicate this problem. The main transport medium for the average Salvadoran is bus and if you live here and go downtown on a Monday at 5PM you'll be able to see the busses extremely filled with people like sardines in a can (which reminds me the Japanese metro system that also is like that). So, historically, these buses have been the areas where many murders and assaults have occurred, due to its importance for the work of people and its importance for the whole country, the gangs have taken them several times in our history, perpetrating once one of the worst terrorist attacks of our country, when they burned a whole bus full of people. In our collective history, it is in the mind of every Salvadoran and that is the reason why every Salvadoran has a deep fear of our transportation system even tho we have to use it every day if we want to go to work or move around the city. We just learned to live with that fear, I am not rich, and I am young, my current job barely gives me food for the month and I can't afford a car. We have a big hope in the current government, which has proven that they listen to the citizens concerns and most important needs and that is the reason for their success, that is the reason why left them approve the Bitcoin law, because even we didn't know what bitcoin was, they have done a work that is so good that we trusted them blindly when they announced it, we just thought ""they have done a good job until now, this bitcoin thing must be something good also"". Some few detractors that are here and there don't understand none of this, and they think that is because Nayib wears a cap and says nice things, but actually, we, the average people have been able to see the results of their work as a team, not just Nayib but all the people who works in these projects. Those detractors, a fewer number of them have so much money that they pay people to spread fake news all over the world and over the web. They used to pay politicians and powerful people to do whatever they wanted, but with Nayib on the head they aren't able to do that. That's why they are angry. And soem people who are detractors and tell you about recent murdering stories, if you ask them how they know about it you realize that it is the story of a friend of a friend of a friend who saw something in Instagram of Facebook. Yes, still there are murders, but not in our face, people now go out and enjoy the day, they fill the parks with their families and friends, even these friends who told me these recent murder stories, they go camping. 

&amp;#x200B;

**We need talent.** 

We have so many good programmers that work for companies overseas, one of my closest friends is one of them. We have many people who can speak English like me, and other languages (I learned Japanese in order to get a job), because of that need to survive we learned all of there things because we became **experts** in telecommunications and remote work even before the pandemic, with call centers. That is the reason why many of the call center services in the world are located here. I live some minutes to one of these places, they have thousands of people working here in that type of job and almost all of the roommates who I have lived with speak English everyday in their jobs and some of them also French. But due to the reason that all the development is in the capital city, all of us have moved here! Even young people in the most distant towns learn English with the only hope that it will take them out of poverty. Call center is offered here as the only alternative to have a job. And it is better paid than doctors or engineers. But it has a vary dark side. It is just labor exploitation. The bosses make them work in insane non human timeframe schedules with no chance to go to the bathroom or eat in many cases. Sometimes they have lunch but it is a very short timeframe and they have so many over-stress problems to the point where almost all of their workers have stomach problems and mental health issues. it is common in those buildings to have stories about workers who committed suicide or just died from heart attacks and the company doesn't care about them. I was trapped in one of these places and thanks to them I improved my English but thanks to internet jobs, NFT gaming and crypto earnings me and some of my friends were able to leave that f\*\*\*g slavery behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still think we need more talent. it is yet not enough to compete with the US or Japan, much or our own talent moved to these countries in the previous decades and it is understandable because we were living in hell over here. But now our challenge is to bring talent over here and improve more and more the living conditions for them. We still have a lot of beautiful nature, short travel times (the country itself is small), rich culture, delicious food, friendly people! But the government has been working in lowering those crime rates, building a lot of bridges, improving infrastructure like freeways, streets, the water system, transportation, building a new airport and improving the one we already have, building new hospitals and they have a huge new school system plan, they made a new new born program from all the new babies that come to life here to come in better conditions and the president and his team themselves were in 2019 overseas looking for opportunities telling investors and other governments that we exist. Bitcoin was just one of these things at that time, that we had no idea was going to put us in the eye of people (as good or bad). There is so much that we want to do and to little people, that we do what we can at a time.   


So, the Bitcoin City is going to be built in the middle of all of this. And our hopes are on it. A city takes several years to be built but we are working in order to make it a true reality.

These bonds will be 5 year bonds, trading at 6.5%. Put bluntly, that level of interest on Salvadoran bonds, even in Bitcoin, is ridiculously low.

Let me explain. If you look at regular Salvadoran bonds, you will see that the interest rate on their 20 year bonds due 2023 is 7.75%, and on their 10 year bonds due 2029 is 8.625%. You may think that is an acceptable bitcoin discount. However, this is not the correct number to use-we need to use yield.

Yield is, basically, the interest rate scaled to the bond’s current price. This makes sense, because if you buy a $1000 bond paying 4% for 500 its really paying you 8%. So lets look at El Salvador’s yields. The first one, due 2023, has a yield of a [whopping 26.5%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012aj55-el-salvador-republik-7-75-02-23). The second one, due 2029, has a yield of a [still-high 15%](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/bond/usp01012bx31-el-salvador-republik-8-625-17-29). If these bonds would be due in 2027, you could reasonably expect a yield between those two figures (a linear approximation would expect 19%, but linear approximations are not very useful in bond trading imo).

Now, you could tell me that its worth buying a bitcoin bond at full price for 6.5% interest, or even at a premium-if bitcoin goes up, you win, after all. Not so fast-this runs into what’s called currency risk. If the price of bitcoin doubles, and El Salvador has spent the bitcoin it gained from the bonds on construction of Bitcoin City, then El Salvador will have to come up with more value to pay you back than they recieved. This happens in countries where there is little faith in the home currency-when Mexican companies issued dollar denominated bonds and the peso crashed, there were significant concerns about ability to pay. Same thing applies here.

Bitcoin Bonds are a cool idea, and a novel one. However, they should not be sold at 1/3 of the yield as a dollar-denominated bond. Bukele is trying to take advantage of Bitcoiners to raise capital cheaply-be cautious.

It is a brave step forward that could propell El Salvador as an economically prosperous country. Creating these strong economic and tax incentives for businesses to migrate to your country is the FASTEST way for El Salvador to become first world. If you look at all of the countries that have transitioned from 3rd world to 1st world over the last 20 years (South Korea, Singapore, Israel, UAE, and Qatar), they all have one thing in common: they became hyper-capitalist. If done correctly, I think El Salvador could have a GDP per capita competitive with Europe in the next 20 years.

However, Nayib Bukele's presentation was almost too good to be true. It's easy for politicians to make promises on a stage, but it's a lot harder to deliver those promises. The logistics of building this city is far more challenging for El Salvador than Bukele's presentation made it out to be. El Salvador is also a poor third world country full of corruption, so even if the city gets built, there may be some undesirable qualities of the city that we might now like.

Obviously, as everyone here knows, you can't ban cryptocurrency -- it's literally just some calculations and the ability to send information. What I don't get is why people don't seem to understand this. No government has the power to do this; you might as well ban the weather. Actually, banning the weather would be easier.

My guess is that people imagine government to be some omnipotent being, basically 'god.' I can't make sense of it any other way. Regardless, it's a totally incoherent point of view.

At most, governments could ban exchanges, but even that would be really hard to enforce, and you could still trade bitcoin for goods directly. I think it's important to emphasize that no cryptocurrency project, not even any shitcoin, has died because of government action. They've died because people didn't want to use them, that's all. And, if anything, when authoritarian/fascist governments express animosity towards a concept, for most people that only makes the concept more desirable.

Bitcoin City is the proposed micro Dubai of El Salvador. As a citizen of this place, you will enjoy:

 - Zero payroll taxes
 - Zero capital gains taxes
 - Zero real estate taxes
 - Zero electric or heating bills as the volcano's geothermal will make the city a zero carbon metropolis
 - 10% VAT (value added tax, like sales taxes)

The bonds will be issued on Liquid Network (a bitcoin sidechain) for $1B. The smallest increment you can buy is $100, and requires you stake (tie-up) your bitcoin for 5 years.

El Salvador will use $500M of that to buy bitcoin, and to buy mining equipment. The other $500M will be for city and volcano [geothermal] energy infrastructure.

The bond coupon (interest rate) is 6.5% APY

After 5 years, a special dividend will be awarded as they slowly begin liquidating their BTC.

They plan on servicing the bond coupon (paying the interest rate to bond holders) with:

 - 50% of the VAT
 - Profits made from mining
 - An appreciation of bitcoin's price

The risk/reward here for them is enormous. Will the shanty town of corrugated metal huts and its people move willingly? Will enough private capital pour in to build the homes, bring the businesses? Can President Bukele (pronounced Bū-kā-lee) be trusted to deliver? This is an incredible undertaking. 

If bitcoin were to say double from where it is today, they will have made the best move in their small country's history. They'll have more or less financed a city from a swamp, improved tens of thousands of lives in the area, attracted foreign investment and citizenship (which they plan on lowering requirements to ownership of 1 BTC), and proven the longterm belief that bitcoin by its nature incentives green energy along the way to reduce its own liability.  

Even if the bond sale itself (they do plan on 10 of them so $10B total) sells out quickly, it will be enough to capture the attention of many other Latin American countries and countries around the world. It's hard to explain what effect large lockups of BTC and subsequent buys-investment-adoption of this could have. Already we're getting late in the distribution phase and over a decade of longterm accumulation will give us a major supply shock sometime in early 2023 (most claims heretofore have been dubious, but we're getting close). 

For investors sitting on a surplus, I see no downside, especially ones like myself that are longterm hodlers anyway. I can't say I'm a big fan of sidechains like Liquid Network or some of Bukele's political maneuvering, but El Salvador has thought outside the hyper-imperialism that the US dollar has boxed so many desperate countries into. So I see it as a duty, in fact, to support El Salvador's endeavor with a small allocation of BTC to volcano🌋 bonds. Maxi's, dear reader, are like the thorns that grow when a rose is young to protect it until it flowers. Because you have to understand that **ADOPTION** is the most important part of bitcoin's success now. Not price, not regulation, nothing but adoption. So I implore those that bought their first hard wallet or stacked their first SATS to educate those around you and be patient with them, but relentless:

Mining machines quite literally make money, so manufacturers can command a very high price for them – if they choose to do so. Used machines are available but only because they are obsolete and no longer profitable to run. The average price for a current technology based mining rig is around $12,000 - not including import taxes and shipping which can easily cost another $3000. Even with very cheap electricity it will take over 23 months to break even, assuming that Bitcoin stays at around $60k and that the network hash rate stays at 160 EH. Several of the mining companies have recently raised very significant amounts of money, and stated that they want to raise their share of mining rewards next year. It’s a pretty safe bet that the network hash rate will rise significantly, so the $15,000 rig may never break even. What’s surprising is that said rig costs only $1700 to manufacture, and that includes all overheads and amortised design costs.

Lots of people would like to mine Bitcoin, but they soon find out that efficient mining rigs are way out of their price range; how many regular folks can readily access $1000 let alone $12,000? We want to open up profitable mining to everyone, even if they can only afford $100 – **and that’s a one off payment**. It won’t buy them their own mining rig but our project will generate *continuous* income for them, pretty much regardless of Bitcoin’s value, the network hashing rate or the reward halving in May 2024. They won’t have to worry about electricity costs, rig efficiency, burnt out hashing boards, new technologies and importantly, privacy - we don’t need or want to know who our investors are or what taxes they pay in their jurisdictions.

**What’s** ***really*** **important here is that the little guys can for once compete on a level playing field with the mining companies and rig manufacturers.**

The project needs funding of $65 million to enable:

\- an initial hashing power of just over 4.2 EH using 10 nm (Intel) or 7 nm (TSMC) technology

\- construction of a suitably secured, level paved site in Iceland and /or Norway of around 10 acres (4 Hectares)

\- a direct grid connection initially with 2 x 120 MVA power transformers and associated switchgear

\- construction of  modified shipping containers to hold hashing modules and immersion cooling equipment

40% of net revenues go to building more equipment, 40% goes to the initial funders, 10% for local taxation and 10% goes to the company for profit and R &amp; D, this enables income to more than keep up with increases in the network hashing rate. Our hashing containers will each hold 0.536 EH of mining power. When fully equipped with their individual distribution transformers and switch gear they will cost approximately $5.5 million each.

If successfully funded it will take around 14 months to get the electronic/power infrastructures built, tested and commissioned. The initial hashing power per $100 invested equates to 6.6 TH, but will increase by more than 10 times that by the end of 2023, by which time the **monthly** income per $100 will be approximately $120. Yes, you read it correctly. Income will be paid monthly and will start to flow around month 16; by month 24 an initial $100 invested will have been paid back and generated at least an extra $600 in income ($90,000 if $15,000 was put in), and because of the uniqueness of our concept the income will keep coming month after month.

**THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME.**

Like any other investment this project carries an element of risk, so never gamble what you can’t afford to lose. Does the Howey Test classify this project as a security? Yes it does, but the company won’t be based in the USA or Singapore and we will only be able to identify investors by their wallet address, nothing else.

We hope to have our website up and running by the first week in December. Meantime, if you have any sensible questions please use the forums so that everyone can see the replies.

3 As Jesus (Satoshi) was sitting on the Mount of Olives (Bitcoin Volcano), the disciples (developers) came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming (the bitcoin standard) and of the end of the age (legacy finance)?”

4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ (Bitcoin Jesus, Craig Wright) and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars (China bans Bitcoin) and rumors of wars (India bans Bitcoin), but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end (hyperbitcoinization) is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation (US denounces El Salvador), and kingdom against kingdom (altcoins wars). There will be famines (rug-pulls) and earthquakes (centralized exchange hacks) in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains (hyper adoption).

9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death (IRS audits), and you will be hated by all nations (FUD peddlers) because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets (altcoin shills) will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end (BTC maxis) will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end (hyperbitcoinization) will come.

15 “So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ (money printing) spoken of through the prophet Daniel (Michael Saylor) —let the reader understand— 16 then let those who are in Judea (telegram groups) flee to the mountains (/r/bitcoin). 17 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house (centralized exchanges). 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak (VPN). 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women (fiat holders) and nursing mothers (stablecoin holders)! 20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter (bear market) or on the Sabbath (exchange downtime). 21 For then there will be great distress (fiat hyperinflation), unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equaled again.

22 “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect (Bitcoin holders) those days will be shortened. 23 At that time if anyone (/r/btc, /r/bitcoinsv) says to you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. 24 For false messiahs (altcoin devs) and false prophets (altcoin shills) will appear and perform great signs (fee-less transactions) and wonders (PoW) to deceive, if possible, even the elect (Bitcoiners). 25 See, I have told you ahead of time.

26 “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ (altcoin merchant adoption) do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ (altcoin institutional adoption) do not believe it. 27 For as lightning (LN) that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man (hyperbitcoinization). 28 Wherever there is a carcass (scam coin), there the vultures (altcoin gamblers) will gather.

29 “Immediately after the distress of those days

“‘the sun (Federal Reserve) will be darkened, 
    and the moon (JPow) will not give its light;
the stars (Yellen) will fall from the sky,
    and the heavenly bodies (central banks) will be shaken.’ 
30 “Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man (Bitcoin as legal tender) in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth (anti-BTC politicians) will mourn when they see the Son of Man (hyperbitcoinization) coming on the clouds of heaven, with power (hash rate) and great glory. 31 And he will send his angels (Bitcoin miners) with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect (Bitcoin holders) from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

32 “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out (layer 2 solutions), you know that summer is near. 33 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. 34 Truly I tell you, this generation (ASIC hardware) will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 35 Heaven (central banks) and earth (governments) will pass away, but my words (Bitcoin whitepaper) will never pass away.

The Day and Hour Unknown

36 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven (cloud miners), nor the Son (Satoshi), but only the Father (the Blockchain). 37 As it was in the days of Noah (Max Keiser), so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man (hyperbitcoinization). 38 For in the days before the flood (2008 financial crisis), people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah (Keiser) entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood (market crash) came and took them all away (foreclosures). That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man (hyperbitcoinization). 40 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken (no-coiner) and the other left (Bitcoiner). 41 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken (banker) and the other left (node operator).

42 “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. 43 But understand this: If the owner of the house (centralized exchange) had known at what time of night the thief was coming (exchange hack), he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. 44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man (hyperbitcoinization) will come at an hour when you do not expect him.

45 “Who then is the faithful and wise servant (OG Bitcoiner), whom the master has put in charge of the servants (Bitcoin noobs) in his household to give them their food (hopium) at the proper time? 46 It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. 47 Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions (diamond hands). 48 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’ ('Bitcoin is dying') 49 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants (BTC shorts) and to eat and drink with drunkards (altcoin investors). 50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him (bullrun) and at an hour he is not aware of. 51 He will cut him to pieces (liquidation) and assign him a place with the hypocrites (/r/buttcoin), where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",3597328,The Destruction of the Temple (Legacy Financial System) and Signs of the End Times (Hyperbitcoinization),0,1.0,2021-11-24 20:05:37,NEGATIVE,0.9967992305755615

Hello Everyone!

Over the past year and half Crypto has changed my life, and I am truly grateful for the community and the amazing opportunities it has brought for me. I wanted to give back with something I have to offer for everyone interested!

Long story short:

I placed an order for 1300 Antminer S9 miners in October last year, back when they were $50 a piece (insane that these are now over $500). Why did I do this? I knew that a bull run would be inevitable that year and took advantage before it all began. However, the contract that had been signed with the supplier wasn't held to its terms. The crypto rally began and the supplier was furious to cut me out of the deal. Months of hassling and getting lawyers involved through court over the past year, I was finally able to receive my order last month. What a headache the entire process had been.

Over the year, my investments in crypto provided more for me than I could have ever imagined. I now have all these miners and am not sure what to do with them. I would like to keep 300 but want to give 1000 away to the community to people looking into mining bitcoin.

Dividing out my costs each S9 miner ended up costing me roughly $80 and in todays market these go for about $500-700 each. I am willing to sell these for $200 each as it would cover shipping costs to you guys and other logistics in the process.

I choose to setup a quick Shopify Page to help manage the orders and the payments and to ensure a safe and secure process for you guys. Here is the information for it all:

Site: [dooblybloobly.myshopify.com](https://dooblybloobly.myshopify.com/)

Cost: $200 a piece (limit to 5 a person to ensure many people can avail this opportunity to dabble into crypto)

Shipping: North America only (sorry rest of the world) I will manually verify and label each package and hope to send them out in about 1-2 weeks

Payments: Accepted through Coinbase which is integrated into the website

ROI: At current prices expect an ROI in about 1.5 months taking out electricity costs (which is really good)

My motive is to get as many people into the crypto mining space as possible and if you are already in it, well here is a small gift! I hope you guys like this!

I am expecting these to sell out fast!

Over the past year and half Crypto has changed my life, and I am truly grateful for the community and the amazing opportunities it has brought for me. I wanted to give back with something I have to offer for everyone interested!

Long story short:

I placed an order for 1300 Antminer S9 miners in October last year, back when they were $50 a piece (insane that these are now over $500). Why did I do this? I knew that a bull run would be inevitable that year and took advantage before it all began. However, the contract that had been signed with the supplier wasn't held to its terms. The crypto rally began and the supplier was furious to cut me out of the deal. Months of hassling and getting lawyers involved through court over the past year, I was finally able to receive my order last month. What a headache the entire process had been.

So I thought I'd post this here. About 12 moths ago I was arrested,  a very heavy arrest. It would be something like a swat team, 50 police off and lots of big guns. 
Previous to the arrest I was partner at a company working with crypto.
They arrested me and my partner on charges of money laundering. The authorities stated we were facilitating the laundering of illegally obtained funds. We were not.
The authorities confiscated all our assets fiat and crypto,  sold off the crypto and destroyed our company. Strangely enough when the authorities sold off our crypto they sold a part of it to a dark net market wallet (we use chainalysis,  so I can prove this).
Within our work we made 100's of reports to the financial regulators which are on file and would be in phone contact with them on a weekly basis. The regulator was genuinely shocked when we informed them what had happened. The authorities didn't inform the financial regulator about their investigation.

We are now 12 months down the road from then and we have had zero updates, no funds returned and zero court date planned. Honestly I can't see it going before a judge since there is zero evidence.

 BTC’s sideways price action has pushed some traders into altcoins . We saw the 60k support hold very well, as bulls were dominating that level! Some whales alerts to at 60 150 lever buying big. 

That sign of accumulation is bullish for the long term.

If margin exposure stays low we could head to a knew ATH after restesting 63k

If 63k doesn't break we may see a pull back to try to find more liquidity testing 60k again or 57k

Not only with my regular financial accounts, but especially my bitcoin. It's getting to a point where if my Bitcoin were to get locked up forever it would be devastating for those I love.

Now I know how Bitcoin works and how to properly secure it myself, but I would just like some ideas for those of you who have gone through the process of teaching family members or significant others how to access it. 

I currently Keep my Bitcoin on a Cold Card with a passphrase connected to my home node. I know the Cold Card is probably the most confusing hardware wallet for non Bitcoin people which doesn't help. I also use Casa 2 of 3 multisig setup and have my BTC split between Casa and the CC. So three hardware wallets in total and obviously all seed phrases + passphrase + xpubs for the multisig are written down written down.

It just feels overwhelming to even begin teaching people how these work. How many people have you trusted? I will obviously teach my significant other, but should I also teach my Mother, Sister, etc for redundancy? Outside of all this the only thing I'm not 100% on is how my node effects access to others. I guess they would either need my computer login + wallet login to even access my Bitcoin or they would have to know how to fully restore a ColdCard via sd on a different computer thats not connected to my node. While I love my CC + passphrase + node setup as I feel its the most secure for me personally, I'm definitely getting anxiety imagining people trying to figure it out and not being able to if needed.

Will it matter how much crypto or money you have anymore? The world should become a giant middle-class where work is optional and only ideas of value make it out. Sure there will be billionaires, but will it matter? Will they matter? They'll be rich, but have no power anymore like they do today.

I thought I would share a bit of an educational post on the ShakePay app that is available in Canada, as I find its really an amazing tool for easy, free BTC every day, and not many people know about it, and that's a shame.

So ShakePay is a very simple UI app that you can purchase either BTC or ETH on the platform, without any fees, but the company makes money on a small spread they charge you. They have a promo on right now, if you sign up and buy $100 worth, they give you a free $30, so instant 30% return. Not too bad. HOWEVER, the real gem on this app is the feature they don't even advertise.

If you sign up through someone's referral link, it unlocks a ""shaking sats"" feature, where you can once a day go in the app and just shake your phone. Yes, just physically give your phone a shake, and boom! they deposit a little bit of free BTC in your account. Each day you do this, your streak increases, and they give you a little more, little more.

Right now, I'm personally on a 173 day streak, and Im earning about 76 cents of BTC each shake. It adds up because this is every day!

So I thought I would spread the word, inform other Canadians about this great app we have access to (sorry Americans, but you always get the cool stuff generally), and let people know, if they sign up (with a referral from someone) that this cool hidden bonus feature gets unlocked. Im not sure why they dont advertise this better themselves!

involved with an investment called global trading alliance

when I'm at silver plan I make money every week like I can

about $5000 worth of Bitcoin then an account manager
convinced me to level up into a diamond plan which is
starting of 100k to 1M usd he told me to try get a loan in a
bank. So because of successfully making money in that
silver account I got convinced then I did a 100k loan
which is ended up my 2nd mortgage of my house. I got
the money then the account manager told me to transfer
it via Bitcoin. After I did it the account manager became
cold to me I asked how long it will take to get the return of
my investment. He said a bank will call me on how I can
get the earnings from my investment. A bank emailed me.
https://sibshorecapital.com said I have to make an
account to their bank so I can get my money. I did it. So
then they sent me an email again asking for $11,580 for
crypto to fiat conversion fee plus admin fee and send it
thru Bitcoin transaction I did hoping I can get my money.
After paying them they emailed me again and said I got a
stop order report it's a dossier report and they're
requesting me to pay that fee so I can get the money the
dossier fee cost $8599 Bitcoin transaction. I ended
paying that too hoping that I can get my money. A day
after I got a email again they're stating that I have to pay
5 percent tax from the investment I did I asked them if
they can take it from the funds that I'm expecting it cost
$20,970 Bitcoin transaction again. I told them I can't
payed them anymore because I don't have money
anymore I maxed out every account that I have. For some

blocked me. They're websites costumer service don't

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this particular question but just a quick question in regards to sim swapping if anyone can help me out and answer this for me

So sim swapping is where someone calls your provider claiming to be you and saying that they lost my phone and requests to get a new sim card sent to x address. Once they have your sim card, they can pretty much bypass any 2fa method that is using your phone number

So my question is, can you get 'sim swapped' if you register accounts using a landline number vs your cell phone number? How would someone request to get a card or whatever to gain access to a land line number? If this is the case, wouldnt it be the best to just use your landline number as a verification method rather than your phone if other methods such as authenticator are not available or are land line numbers not safe as well?

Just something i was curious about.

Also, how do you determine the right amount to short in order to balance against a certain amount of holdings? Is anyone consistently doing this and willing to share their experience? 

Brief explainer of the basics for those new to the concept: This is a way you can lock in a certain amount of profit no matter what happens in the market, but in return you trade away any further upside. So if the Bitcoin futures contract for November 30 was $64k and the current Bitcoin price was $63k, you could essentially buy a bitcoin and short the futures contract, and at the end of the month you walk away with $1k profit, no matter what actually happens to the price of Bitcoin.

So in a world governed by code, in the short time we all get to spend on this small rock.. we may as well spend it fighting aggression with love, hostility with patience and disrespect with respect. 

Like the scaling debate technology, code and adoption will ultimately prove the winner.

I then sent funds to the address provided by the BlueWallet watch only wallet, but now I cannot figure out how to access that address in a non-watchonly.

Thank you In advance

&amp;#x200B;

The watch only wallet is in derivation m/44'/0'/0' and the addresses start with a 1

The original wallet in Sparrow was made as Native Segwit( P2WPKH) and is derivation m/84'/0'/0'

&amp;#x200B;

Iv tried restoring the seed into Bluewallet but it doesn't find any transactions

Iv tried many combinations of settings in sparrow, but i cannot find the transactions

&amp;#x200B;

The xpub imported into Bluewallet is somehow different than the xpub in Sparrow

(this part confuses me since i scanned a qr code)

&amp;#x200B;

i cannot get sparrow to generate the same xpub as bluewallet but i was able to generate the same xpub in wasabi wallet, however wasabi only supports m/84'/0'/0' to my knowledge so that still wasnt helpful

&amp;#x200B;

i tried copying the master Pkey from wasabi into sparrow but it wont import on m/44'/0'/0', the button is just grayed out until i change it to m/84'/0'/0'

Taproot is the combination of many Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) resulting in a soft fork of Bitcoin’s blockchain. A soft fork is a proposed upgrade that over time is adopted as the only blockchain, meaning the old one will cease to operate once the new one (in this case, Taproot) is fully adopted.
&gt; 
&gt; **WHAT DOES TAPROOT DO**?
&gt; 
&gt; The improvements can be broken down into three categories, each affecting the other, and each necessary to the final construct. Taproot successfully increases security, and also allows flexibility and scalability with the introduction of a new language that is ever expanding. The three categories of changes to summarize are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; **1) Schnorr Signatures (BIP 340)**
&gt; 
&gt; This new form of signature allows for superior security, lower fees, and flexible multi-signature transactions. How?
&gt; 
&gt; · SigHash (Signature Hash) is applied to the transactions, meaning that once a SigHash is applied, the information becomes immutable (unchangeable). If the information is changed, the transaction loses validity. Nothing can be changed without destroying the SigHash. Previously, a small amount of information could be changed through “malleability” that would not result in the transaction losing its validity. Speaking of signatures …
&gt; 
&gt; · Key and Signature Aggregation allows for the aggregation of public keys and signatures. This means if you have a transaction with 10 people, previously you would need 10 public keys, 10 signatures, and a verifier would have to verify each key and signature. With key and signature aggregation, we can make all 10 public keys into one key, and all 10 signatures, into one signature. The verifier now only has to do this once, instead of 10 times. This is where a lot of computational processing occurs.
&gt; 
&gt; · Superior Security is achieved in the aggregation process because on-chain heuristics (data tracked) will not be able to discern the difference between a multisignature and single-signature transaction, allowing for more privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; · Batch Verification is added on from the aggregation mentioned above, as now we can “batch” together multiple transactions, to verify them together, as opposed to one at a time. Basically, this is just “bulk verification,” and also leads to fewer resources being spent.
&gt; 
&gt; **2) Taproot (BIP 341)**
&gt; 
&gt; The entire update is named after this portion because this is how the new system integrates with the old one.
&gt; 
&gt; · Bitcoin Script Update allows the scripting language to use Schnorr signatures and integrates the Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST).
&gt; 
&gt; · Pay-To-Taproot (P2TR) gives the freedom of choice. You can use either Schnorr signatures or the Merkle root provided in MAST. Satisfy the requirements of your choosing, which allows for cleaner transaction processing when the Merkle tree may not be needed.
&gt; 
&gt; (MAST) summarizes the possible scripts that are needed to unlock a bitcoin, instead of requiring all the possible scripts for the transaction. The single-script hash provided by MAST actually represents several scripts. To spend a bitcoin, you need only provide your script, and provide proof that your script is held in the Merkle root. Previously, it would have taken far more scripts and extended verification.
&gt; 
&gt; **3) Tapscript** 
&gt; 
&gt; *Transcript* is a collection of “opcodes,” which are essentially just lines of codes that execute commands on the Bitcoin protocol that have been updated to make way for the new changes installed by Taproot. It can be referred to as a language, but it is more like an update to Bitcoin Script.
&gt; 
&gt; · Bitcoin Script has a 10,000-byte script size limit which will be removed, allowing for vastly larger scripts, or Taproot contracts. It also removes the cap for “opcodes,” which allows for more flexibility for increased features and coding in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; · This removal of script size and unfettered growth available in scripting allows a clear path to smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; **WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?**
&gt; 
&gt; Security is the lifeblood of every Bitcoiner. Unwilling to shake their core beliefs of hard, sound money, the Bitcoin community paced themselves to make sure the Layer 1 (Bitcoin protocol) was immutable, efficient, and proven to be 100% secure before “upgrading.” Other platforms rushed to Layer 2 (open applications built on the original protocol) while Bitcoin held off on further developments until base-layer security was an undeniable certainty. Because of this, some argue that Bitcoin had lost the race to developing smart contract capability, and products like Ethereum emerged as first to market, changing the way we look at decentralized applications.
&gt; 
&gt; Taproot has evened the playing field. Bitcoin now has a clear path to deployment of smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and more. Products like the Lightning Network have already shown that fast and reliable transactions can still be backed with an immutable ledger, even without the access that Taproot will give developers of the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is stepping into a broader world with applications that we cannot imagine in a way that it simply could not before. This newfound developer freedom and systemic efficiency for the miners will drive more great minds to the protocol, fostering new ideas which will help the network continue to flourish.

I've never setup such a thing for myself as I generally feel I'm far more likely to lose funds messing around with cold-wallets than I am to experience a hack, plus I like the interest payments. I explained this to her, but she still wants to do this. So, after a little research, I decided that the ledger Nano-X was the best fit for her...and me. I know there are other ways to do it for free, but I'm paranoid about messing up somehow and the Nano-X has a pretty intuitive user-interface. 

I fully expect her to pay me generously, especially because I know she's rich as hell and I've seen her pay my girlfriend ridiculous amounts of cash for silly things like watering her plants or feeding the cat, but because she's such a crypto-noob, I'm also a little worried about her. first of all, despite explaining to her what cold-storage is and how it's secured, she fully intends on letting me, her tenant's boyfriend and random dude seems really into crypto, set up her cold-wallet, a process that will undoubtedly expose her seed phrase/private keys to me. 

She's already ordered the Ledger at my direction, but I set up a meeting with her tomorrow to go over the basics of offline/cold-storage, basically everything I learned in the last couple days after agreeing to help her. The only reason I really agreed to help her is because my girlfriend convinced me it's probably worthwhile to curate a good relationship with someone so wealthy. 

The only thing is, although we haven't gone into much detail about which coins she holds and how much, I fully expect her to have at least $1-3 million in crypto. I've never been a thief or scammer, so I suppose she's lucky to have crossed paths with me, but I worry whether she's responsible/capable enough to be trusted with a cold-wallet setup and paper seed-phrase. I'd prefer not to know her seed phrase at all, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if she lost it or somehow shared it with someone else. Like I said, the process of setting this up by yourself with Ledger, as you should for obvious reasons, is fairly easy and the fact that she seems unable/unwilling to do this despite having so much money at stake is concerning for me to the point that I don't know if cold-storage is necessarily the smartest choice for her. However, her heart seems set and if I don't help her, I worry she'll start looking for someone else who maybe doesn't have quite so much integrity.

MY TERRIBLE THOUGHT &amp; THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE CREATED THIS MONETER:

- How do Miners select which transactions they process? Is it all based on first come, first serve, second only to a descending hierarchy of fees that each ""seller"" is willing to pay?

- What establishes this ""miners transaction processing selector"" (MTPS)? Does each miner have their own algorithm that they code their equipment to? Or does the mining equipment come pre coded to a common ""MTPS""? 

- What would happen if someone or some entity wanted to crush bitcoin, and attempted to do so with enough 1SAT transfers to clog it up for a month or a year or indefinitely? Which would only take ~17M transactions/month. At the top of the hierarchy fee, that's only $21M/month. Now I'd assume, this would make fees go up, but say money isn't a problem to this person/entity (say it was PRC or Uncle Sam for example) and they just kept increasing their fee. 

- How would the miners prevent this kind of attack? Would it get to a point that only certain levels of bitcoin could ever be traded? Say &gt;1BTC trades minimum, (or whatever arbitrary quantity it would take to relinquish the attacker.)  Does anyone know if BTC is resilient to this sort of attack??

That's not true! You can in fact contribute as much as you want. From the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits):

&gt; *""Excess contributions are taxed at **6% per year** for each year the excess amounts remain in the IRA.""*

Here's why this is important.

Contributing in excess CAN be very profitable if you intend to HODL *or trade* in that account until after the 59.5yo tax-free distribution age. Pay 6%/year tax on the excess contribution (not gains) then withdraw tax-free, vs. paying 15% (or probably 20% by then) capital gains, or worse if you traded/held short-term.

Let's say you're 49.5yo, and have $106k in cash to buy BTC with, and intend to let it sit for 10 years. Let's say BTC is $50k.
* If you open a [Bitcoin Self-Directed IRA](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kez34d/bitcoin_ira_that_lets_you_keep_private_keys/giuoj0y/), you'll pay 6% tax on $100k, for 10 years. That's $6000 * 10 = $60k. Then you sell those 2 BTC *in the SDIRA*, and withdraw the USD tax-free.
* In a regular account, you'd HODL the 2 BTC, then in 10 years you incur a 15% (and 20% for the amount above ~$450k; the threshold will increase with inflation) long-term capital gains tax when you do anything with it.

So if 15% of (2 * Bitcoin_Price_In_10_years - $100k) is greater than $60k, you should have contributed the $100k into the SDIRA. Which means your gain needs to be over $400k ($60k / 0.15), which means 2 BTC must be over $500k, which means BTC must be $250k in 10 years, i.e. go 5x.

Has anyone done this? Anyone plans to?

If you don't have $100k in cash,

* you could sell $100k (or whatever amount) of coins ([contributions to IRA accounts must be in USD](https://intercom.help/bitcoin-ira/en/articles/1425378-using-bitcoin-to-fund-ira-account); you can't roll crypto into them)
* you can contribute smaller amounts annually, but still over $6k. In that case you'll pay less tax than in the scenario above, but BTC will also appreciate over time.

**In other words, if you want to DCA into Bitcoin until you're 59.5yo, you might want to do so in a Bitcoin SDIRA. Forget about the $6k/year ""limit""**

------

If you suspect you might withdraw early though, then the SDIRA is a bad choice vs. HODL-ing in a wallet or regular account, because of the 10% early withdrawal fee, AND [ordinary income tax rates](https://np.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/qrgvu/how_much_will_i_owe_if_i_withdraw_money_from_my/c3zy7tf/) instead of long-term capital gains.

We're not some multimillion dollar business, but we work incredibly hard to bring quality work to our clients and we just wanted to earn something that would equally represent a fair value trade for our services. The product we produce is going to last a very long time and earning in a dying currency which doesn't even keep its value for a year doesn't seem like an even trade off on the time and effort we put towards the work. So something had to change.

Earlier in the year I experimented on two fronts (1) putting Bitcoin on the balance sheet and (2) accepting Bitcoin as payment for projects. It's been a game changer for us.  

Everyone, from my accountants, employees and clients were skeptical at first. I had to coax our clientele by offering serious discounts if they paid in Bitcoin, but it paid off. It paid off because we've seen a bit more capital growth/appreciation which has allowed us to expand the team and acquire new equipment during rallies. 

In the middle of the year, I  took on the experiment of learning how to live on Bitcoin. Part of the reason was to see if it was feasible as a means of payment, how to use it in the day-to-day with all its plusses and minuses, and to be able to help onboarding anyone who decided to accept Bitcoin as their means of payment. It's been a real education, but what I've learned has been incredibly valuable that my admin and accountant team have a much better appreciation for what Bitcoin is doing to our economy as a whole. We're still early, but I was in one of the MicroStrategy workshops and as they put it, ""we're still early. How we use Bitcoin today will create the policies of tomorrow."" 

We haven't worked out all the kinks yet, but we're in a good position to start issuing payments in Bitcoin, whether they want a portion of their pay or all of it, come Dec 1. 

Been working with the local small business chamber and government bodies too to help other small businesses learn to accept Bitcoin (both on-chain and on Lightning). 

Not really sure where else to share the excitement considering that in my field, what we're doing is kind of a first and I still get the occasional eye-roll from my peers. 

Heard you Sat Stackers were a good place to share this kind of news with.

If you hold a considerable amount of Bitcoin you could practically retire with the big apy they are paying at crypto.com. Not saying I'm quite there, but it could put a decent dent in my expenses. However I don't think I'm going to do it, and here is why.


The only way crypto.com can generate that big apy is by investing in other assets, lending it out again to others at higher apy, or trading it. None of these are guaranteed to be net profitable in any given year. In fact it can be quite the opposite in a bad year, some principal can be lost. Statistically, over the long run, there seems to be an increasing probability of losses to principal deposits. Think of every year as a game of Russian Roulette.


So does a company like crypto.com pass on those losses to depositors like you? Perhaps you deposited 5 BTC and maybe they could reduce your balance to 4 BTC after a particularly rough year. Unacceptable! So what if they promise not to do that no matter how bad things are going with their investments? Let's say there's a big bear market, or they just made the wrong trades, or lent it out to the wrong people who day traded it away. So total deposits were 10000 BTC, but they only have assets worth 8000 BTC now. Let's say their terms and conditions don't allow them to reduce anyone's BTC balance. Then they are running a fractional reserve, and if there's ever a run on the bank, which can happen during a bear market, there will be a few bag holders at the end who only have a receipt from a bankrupt company. QuadrigaCX is a prime example of this, or Bernie Madoff. Both seemed legit for a long time.


But crypto.com has got their name on a sports arena. So come on this must be safe right? I don't know how many of you remember Enron. They had their name on a sports arena also, but one year later they went bankrupt. In fact there is something called the arena naming curse.


I guess I'm just wondering statistically how a company can guarantee your principal and simultaneously guarantee a very high apy, with supposedly no risk of loss to your principal? Statistically this seems impossible. It feels an awful lot like Bernie Madoff's wonderful fund which paid reliably for many years, until suddenly everything was gone. What is a ponzi anyway but a fractional reserve on steroids?


So I guess for now I'm not earning anything on my core Bitcoin holdings except capital appreciation and storage of value, but I do own my keys. I remain somewhat tempted however.


P.s. On a related note while I am 90% in Bitcoin, I am approximately 10% in other projects, and I will admit I am earning some interest on those, but only on their native lending platforms. My reasoning there is if those native platforms go bust, the native tokens are liable also to go bust, which means you're screwed even if you owned your keys, so I might as well earn on them, on their own lending platforms. But if the chickens ever come home to roost with all this Bitcoin lending, I guess I feel it prudent to keep at least the core holdings that are in Bitcoin secure, at the cost of some sweet looking apy.",3576630,Crypto.com offers sweet apy but also long term risk,0,1.0,2021-11-19 04:01:37,NEGATIVE,0.9899359345436096

Here are some ideas:

&amp;#x200B;

**Buy, sell, which way will it go!?**

&amp;#x200B;

No - we don't know whether bitcoin is going up or down and if you should buy now. 

Obviously people in this subreddit are generally advocates but that doesn't mean they can predict a market.

&amp;#x200B;

**I had a wallet but I've lost my passphrase or password.**

&amp;#x200B;

If you secured your wallet with a passphrase or password or some other way, there is no way back in if you lose that. This is intended to make bitcoin secure but it carries a responsibility for you as a holder. So if you lose access that bitcoin will forever be unable to be accessed.

Bitcoin's blockchain proves it's available to your address, but if you can't prove you have the keys you'll never get it.

For those who haven't had this problem - secure your passwords. Because nobody else will save you. There is no bank to get it back. Options include using password stores (lastpass, 1password, keepass) and encrypted containers (veracrypt). 

The most secure way will always be to use open source software to do this. This is because the way they work is not hidden and so is much less likely to be compromised. The more comfortable you are with technology the better the choice that's available to you.

Ideally make sure it is kept in more than one place and in a form which is not able to be accessed by anyone but you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin is volatile**

&amp;#x200B;

If you hold bitcoin you need to be aware of and ideally comfortable with volatility. If your previous investments swung a few percent a year understand that you could see many times that in a day which may then flatten, persist or reverse.

Take a look at the history of Bitcoin's price in charts. Understand that the general trend is more easily seen over large time scales like months or years. Days and even weeks can be misleading and stressful.

Here is the actual text:

https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mhh_026_xml__signed.pdf

It fixes every flawed reporting provision of the Infrastructure Bill, and deserves broad support from the crypto community. If you are not American, you should still be supportive, because many countries will follow the lead of the US in this space.

Here is a sample letter that you could email to your local congressional rep and also to your two senators. It is best if you customize it a bit using your own language. But if you don't want to do that, feel welcome to just use it as is.

-------------------

Dear Representative ______ / Dear Senator ____________,

I strongly support the bipartisan Keep Innovation in America Act recently introduced by Representatives Tim Ryan and Patrick McHenry. This Act fixes certain provisions that were tucked into the Infrastructure Bill at the last moment that would be very damaging to America. The Keep Innovation in America Act limits the definition of a broker to any person who “stands ready in the ordinary course of a trade or business to effect sales of digital assets at the direction of their customers.” This would protect crypto miners, developers, and others who can't--and shouldn't--meet reporting requirements of a broker.

To be clear, everyone in the crypto industry agrees that folks should pay whatever taxes they owe. My objection is that the Infrastructure Bill treats everyone—even small businesses and individuals—as if they were financial institutions, and imposes obligations for which compliance is literally impossible.

Therefore, I urge you to publicly support the Keep Innovation in America Act. This is not the last you will hear about this issue, from me or from others. We are persistent. This affects the lives of millions of Americans. This fix would safeguard one of the largest growth engines the world has ever seen. Without this fix, massive wealth, jobs, and technology leadership would be forced out of America and into friendlier jurisdictions. This is an issue that resonates with the rising generations, who feel unheard, unacknowledged, and underappreciated. There is a considerable movement happening, and I urge you to be on the right side of history.

Respectfully,

*This slowly erodes the dollar peg as more goods and services are able to be sold and bought in BTC, whereby fewer people exchange BTC for fiat*

#2 **Reduce its liability by mining with over 100% green/renewable energy**

*So far the only way to incentivize green energy especially when fossil fuel prices are cheap, has been artificial: government manipulation of the tax code. Bitcoin should emerge as the missing link, incentivizing the green energy projects of tomorrow by reducing its own associated debt. This is when things get quite interesting because the current mining economy of scale will break. Right now 32% of mining is green, up from 10% 5 years ago. At the current velocity, this is achievable this decade.*

#3 Voluntary adoption of the Satoshi Standard

*It will start with you and I the users, and non-custodial wallets. From there nodes will press the issue making it impossible for CEX's and miners to not comply. This also helps break the dollar peg further.*

Bitcoin is not *crypto*. That would assume there's some kind of parity between Bitcoin and altcoins/stablecoins.

Also: Bitfinex, Tether, and Tether Limited, I'll use interchangeably in this post, because there's no reason to believe any of these things are separate from one another, other than by some small legal fiction. 

**New Day, Same Old Fraud, **

Bitfinex and its brass will soon have inquiries and global warrants issued for their person. Their golden goose (Tether) meanwhile, will lose its dollar peg on any exchange foolish enough to service them, crashing to 0.15¢ or so, which is about where it's real collateralization stands. Three days ago the Indian government introduced a quasi crypto ban, and we watched Tether drop almost 20% on most exchanges there, before arbitrage traders stepped in, bidding it back up.

Tether Limited is worse than any centralized fractionally reserved bank, and quite frankly, takes the fractional reserve practice to the absolute extreme. Here's a quick breakdown of what Tether is backed by:

 - Cash 2.9%
 - Treasuries 2.2%
 - Reverse Repo Notes 2.7%
 - Fiduciary Deposits 18.4%
 - Commercial Paper 49.6% 😳
 - Secured Loans 12.5%
 - Corporate Bonds 10%
 - Other Investments 1.6%

Commercial paper is the most terrifying there. Commercial paper is something any business can issue  and is a promissory note with a fixed interest rate used to cover short-term receivables. Who's commercial paper do they hold? Nobody knows. We don't know of any company selling commercial paper to Tether Limited, and in some telling, all that commercial paper comes from one place: Bitfinex. Remember that small legal fiction I talked about?

Anybody reading this that holds Tether, positions or assets collateralized with Tether, or keeps money on exchanges that have close relationships with Bitfinex, should exit immediately. 

I have no clue how deep they've burrowed into some of the smaller exchanges. But based upon the way the Volcano 🌋 Bonds of El Salvador work, I'm going to say deep AF. The staking for those interested in buying this $1B tranche of bonds is done through Liquid Network, a sidechain of bitcoin, where interested parties stake their BTC for 5+ years. But Tether Limited is actually the one processing everything on the other end. This means $1B issued to El Salvador in Tether. That's great but, what the hell are *their* terms in small print? Nobody knows. What's the chain of custody look like? Nobody knows shit. It's a system that looks ripe for corruption in both directions.

We will see some smaller exchanges go bust. Most altcoins will get absolutely obliterated, and no savior is coming with bailouts or rescue packages. Tether's market cap is $70B, but its volume is enormous. Enormous as in, larger than BTC, and the next two top crypto's combined. 

**Tether's Crash:**

I believe CZ and Binance will get caught up in this. I believe that many smaller DeFi dapps and yield farms will get zeroed out when collateralizations break. Market leverage will get liquidated. CeFi platforms will be forced to sell much of their positions to stay compliant and safe. Yields will crash and render their business models temporarily broken. Large CEX's like Coinbase will be idled and trading/withdrawals will remain throttled for a day or longer. Politicians the world over will find every reason to bring regulation crashing down on stablecoins or any project that remotely resembles a security like most pre-mined or PoS chains.

Bitcoin will crash to $39k, and most alts will fall 70% or more. The second largest stablecoin which ends in a ""C"" stands to benefit, but not nearly as much as Bitcoin does when the dust settled.

**The good news**

We'll get a v-shape recovery in Bitcoin that week, as the longterm distribution and accumulation more than a decade in the making flexes its strength again. The leverage that Tether enables will go away which will be fantastic and reduce manipulation, reduce selling pressure when Bitcoin dips, and eliminate artificial bullish trading spikes used for options/futures. When bitcoin moves up again, it'll face less resistance. Much of what normally would've gone into Tether outside the US will go into Bitcoin. Tether's trading volume isn't doing anyone a service longterm. And thankfully, many shitcoins (alts) will die with Tether. 

We should hope Tether gets blown up soon. The longer their paper trail gets and the higher that paper gets stacked, the worse it'll be. They're like the Iron Bank in Game of Thrones, except nobody realizes they have no gold yet. 

Nobody should support anything Bitfinex does, nobody should ever use Tether, Nobody should buy anything collateralized in Tether, and no exchange should list Tether. Eventually it goes to 0. Jack Dorsey should also remove its special emoji as well.

**Other Scenarios**

The best scenario for Bitcoin and the worst for crypto, would be that only stablecoins close to fully-backed survive. That means Tether sets off dominos where every stablecoin gets sledged. No algorithmic coin can maintain its peg, no stablecoin backed by crypto can maintain its peg, no synthetic stablecoin can maintain its peg, CEX stablecoins and tokens too. Everything crashes. That might put too much pressure on DeFi and a weeklong bottleneck could develop whereby its only saving grace is oddly $500-$1000 gas fees per transaction. That means CeFi (and some CEX's) be *FUCKED*. They'd either have to throttle operations, or incur enormous losses. In this scenario, Bitcoin could actually begin moving upwards after a v-shape fall as the crypto-asset space burns. 

And the other scenario is we see mass resignations from Tether brass, and serious compliance with regulations, which would suck, because their paper game continues, albeit at a much reduced velocity.

Not much of a poster, more of a reader but wanted to post a quick review of Foldapp, mainly because (1) I’m shocked there aren’t many post about it and (2) I have zero referrals and could use some… anyway here are my thoughts after using for several months.  Feel free to ask questions.

1. Prepaid debit card. There are two options Spin which requires a $25 activation fee and Spin+ which requires a $150 activation fee. Sounds expensive, but I opted for the Spin+ for the higher rewards. This has become my only card I swipe and I have quickly earned back 4x that in Bitcoin from the card in the span of several months.

2. There are two types of spins. One is a daily spin, which you don’t really earn that much back, just a fun way to start the day. This is available for the free accounts so if you sign up, you’ll see what I mean. Basically a quick way to earn 5-25 Sats.

3. The other spin is a prize wheel that activates every time you swipe over $3. This prize wheel changes every month or so and is based off the recommendations they receive from user feedback and social media post. Prizes range from 1% back to 100% back to even 1 full bitcoin. 

4. You can only spin one time unless you have free spins. Free spins are given out every Friday, every time you spend $250 or more on a purchase, and anytime the FoldAPP gang wants (sent several for blackfriday)

5. You can withdrawal anytime your SATs is 50,000 or higher. For me I simply transfer this to an external interest account. 

6. New perk, they have partnered up with the makers of Pokémon for an AR game that lets you collect SATS in the wild. This is brand new and allows you to win free spins and you to 50 SATS daily. This is super cool and fun. 

Overall, super skeptical of any bitcoin venture or new crypto businesses because of all the scams, but FoldAPP is the real deal. I think it is the best way to earn SATS daily and beats out my BlockFi credit card. It’s legit and I highly recommend it to anyone who is just trying to do what they can to stack SATS.

Here is my referral code, $25 in return for those who sign up. Ask me any questions, happy to answer.

Not for the sake of gains, even though admittedly it doesn’t hurt to see greens, but for the sake of when you really do your own research and dive deep into the rabbit hole of BTC it is undeniable that it is the greatest currency ever created (at least for the moment). 

How do average Joe Schmoe’s, and make no mistake I was one at one point very recently, not see what is happening in the world and take initiative to figure it out first hand what BTC really is??

And they wonder why they’re piss broke and not buying Lambos. 

My overall point is I just find it surprising that there’s such an obvious advantage to obtaining BTC, but why don’t people take the steps to self learn?

Treasury Bonds will continue digging deeper as Bitcoin takes over.

Bitcoin addresses the problem of the devaluation of fiat currencies due to careless spending and borrowing. As government spending increases someone needs to buy up the Treasury bonds in order to enable this spending.

However, as of October 31st, 2021 the interest rate for the 10-year Treasury bond is 1.55% — lower than the Federal Reserve’s target inflation rate of 2% — making it a guaranteed loss for these investors.

As investors such as banks, hedge funds and foreign governments begin to slow down their purchases, a decrease in demand will drop U.S bond prices. As a result, the Fed will have to decide on whether to inflate the money supply or to allow higher interest rates.

Based off history and political pressure, it is almost guaranteed for the first option to occur — inflating the money supply — therefore decreasing the inflation-adjusted returns on treasury bonds, again incentivizing investors away from treasuries causing them to fall.𝘺𝘪𝘬𝘦𝘴

Ultimately, investors will then turn to sound money purchasing greater stores of value such as Bitcoin and other assets, while the Fed purchases bonds to control the interest rates.

Although the U.S. Treasury bonds have been the world’s preferred reserve asset, the trillions of dollars of debt (and only increasing) that the U.S. has accumulated since 1971 makes it very unlikely for the treasury bonds to remain as such.

Overtime as Bitcoin increases in liquidity the US will prove to be less creditworthy. Investors, foreign governments and companies are likely to then begin replacing their treasury bond purchases with Bitcoin instead in order to protect themselves against inflation.

Although Bitcoin becomes competition against treasury bonds, it would be a huge mistake for the US government to try to restrict the exchange of Bitcoin. Doing that will prove that the US no longer trusts in the dollar’s competitiveness, jeopardizing its borrowing ability.

Instead the US must embrace Bitcoin especially as they are more likely to benefit the most from bitcoin-related ventures compared to China’s authoritarian financial structure preventing Bitcoin development there. Bitcoin’s open network fits most with the US’s free market system.

Nevertheless, trying to save the treasury bonds will hold back the US from continuing its current lead in innovation and encourage more debt. Instead Bitcoin creates an opportunity for Americans creating jobs, wealth, and protecting themselves against government-driven inflation.

They said that using cash has no fees and that inflation doesn’t count (very debatable, but that’s for another post).

I told them, paper bills cost money to print, and they wear out. That cost either paid for by inflation or taxes or both. There is a cost.

And it’s actually way higher than I expected! https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12771.htm

It costs $0.112 to produce a $20 bill. 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm

And it circulates for approximately 7.8 years?

I found an estimate of how many times a 20£ note (I know, not the same, but close enough for my thought experiment) changes hands in its lifetime: https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/sep/04/how-often-uk-banknotes-change-hands

So if we take 11.2 cents (cost of producing a $20 bill) and divide by 2,328 (estimated number of times a 20£ pound bill change hands in its life) we get 0.0048 cents per time the bull changes hands. 

So, a paper bill costs $0.0048 per transaction.

As of this writing, 1 Satoshi is worth $0.0667

So, a 1 Satoshi transaction on Lightning is the same transaction cost as handing over ~14 bank notes.

So if you move $280 of Bitcoin on the Lightning network, or 14 $20 bills, it costs about the same. 

Pretty wild!

My belief is that either bitcoin becomes THE reserve currency, or it fails completely. There’s not really much middle ground. In 10 or 15 years it will either be worth (almost) EVERYTHING or nothing.  

So I’m interested to hear opinions on what could cause bitcoin to fail and become worthless. The way I see it there are two possibilities:

1) the price gradually declines over time towards zero. 

2) some major black swan event happens and destroys the price overnight. 


I struggle to envisage 1) happening, because a gradually declining price will always tend to get propped up by people looking to time the bottom, if no event has occurred to put people off buying bitcoin altogether. 

Which leaves 2). Bitcoin getting wiped out by some major event. What could that be? A hack? A technical problem? The US making it illegal to hold? (Unenforceable and would just push people underground/offshore.) Some kind of super-FUD I haven’t thought of? Everyone suddenly deciding that another coin does the job better?

She was heartbroken, she had to dig into her retirement funds, but she knew it was the only way she could pay for this life saving operation.

*Quote:* ""One more area that I hope nation-states start paying greater attention to is the rise of cryptocurrencies – because what looks like a very interesting and somewhat exotic effort to literally mine new coins in order to trade with them has the potential for undermining currencies, for undermining the role of the dollar as the reserve currency, **for destabilizing nations**, perhaps starting with small ones but going much larger.""

What does this mean, at least from my point of view. This it's just proof that crypto, it's putting the Fiat system to the test, and it's making noise to the people who have a huge stake at the current status quo of the financial structure that societies have been under, over decades now. Adam tracy also explains how the infrastructure bill is going to impact the crypto space here:  
[https://youtu.be/I2989kkXfUQ](https://youtu.be/I2989kkXfUQ)

And why is that? Why does crypto, and in my opinion specially Bitcoin, can disrupt so abruptly. It's mainly for the 5 services that money needs to provide to society in order to exist, and work for us as a medium of exchange.

What are those 5 services that something has to have in order to become a currency?

1.- Divisibility: Money needs to be divisible, it's a pretty obvious one, if you wan't to buy something expensive you won be carrying 2 trucks full of coins with you, you can just make bigger measures of money or smaller ones for cheap things like a can of soda.

2.- Durability: It needs to be stand the proof of time, and I'm not talking about the agreement on a certain Fiat currency such as USD or EUR, I mean, if you store 5 apples in a bank they're going to be worth nothing in a few days (if you use apples for exchanging goods), but if you put coins, paper, or gold it will be there for a long, long time.

3.- Recognizability: Each trading party can verify the authenticity of the money. Meaning that every transaction that I'm giving you money, you can be secure if it is real, by putting in into that light that reflects certain materials that they put into money, if it would be gold there are other ways to verify if it's real.

4.- Portability: Pretty obvious one, you must be able to move it across time and space without problem.

5.- Scarcity: This is the most important thing about money, and one of the best ways that crypto it's better than Fiat money ruled by Goverments. Scarcity occurs when the demand outstrips supply, so when there is a demand of a certain currency there will be a supply of that currency.

Crypto, just makes the checkmark over these 5 services, and specially Scarcity. Why? Governments and the people who control the flow of currencies, **ALWAYS** takes advantage of the position where they are in, and just print more of that currency in order to have more for them, and less for everybody else, this is just human nature, and you can study a little bit of history and you will notice that this repeats over time on every society.

In the case of Bitcoin, we just have supply of 21,000,000 coins, and no one can make more out of tin air like governments do, when they please. So Scarcity, it's the main advantage that crypto and bitcoin has over Fiat currencies.

So if you ask me, for the reasons that I just gave, Hillary Clinton, just point out the fact that Crypto, it's making the work that we all expect it to be making over time, and it's doing it fast.

* **Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but that doesn’t make it worthless Fed Governor Waller said**
* **The comments come shortly after the Fed policy maker called on Congress to reconsider stablecoin regulatory proposals**

Bitcoin does not have any intrinsic value, but it doesn’t matter, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller said Friday. 

“Bitcoin to me is basically electronic gold,” Waller said [during a discussion with the Center for Financial Stability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSwKgJz8dVk) in response to a question about the risks digital assets pose. “It doesn’t have any fundamental intrinsic value, but that’s okay. We’ve known from economics since 1958 that useless objects can have value.” 

Collectibles are a great example, noted Waller, who mentioned baseball cards and art. Purchasing an object with the belief that it will go up in value is not a new concept in economics, he said. 

Most of the more than 6,000 cryptocurrencies in existence have no value, Waller added, but bitcoin is different. Its value, however, does not inherently make it a threat to the financial system as so many believe, he said. 

“Anybody can issue anything, but most \[tokens\] have zero value, so they’re not a threat to the system,” Waller explained. “Once they pick up, then they become like electronic gold. They’re another asset you can choose to hold. You can choose gold or bitcoin, I don’t care. We don’t sit there worrying about gold prices destabilizing the financial system, per se.”

Investors must know the risk of putting money into cryptocurrencies, just like any other equity or investment vehicle, Waller said. Though he does not see bitcoin as a threat to the current financial system, he added, decentralized finance will likely present new opportunities for advancement. 

“Smart contracts are amazing things that you can do pretty impressive stuff with,” Waller said. “There’s instant clearing and instant settlement. You want fast clearing and settlement? Put a smart contract on the Ethereum network; it’ll settle just like that. So I think it has actually a lot of potential for trading going forward.” 

Waller’s comments on Friday come after he discussed stablecoin regulation, which has [caught the attention of Congress](https://blockworks.co/us-regulators-stablecoin-issuers-should-follow-same-rules-as-banks/) recently, earlier this week. He is not opposed to requiring bank-like regulation for stablecoins, as Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen wants, but he believes that stablecoin issuers should not be required to be banks. 

“I understand the attraction of forcing a new product into an old, familiar structure,” Waller  said during a virtual speech Wednesday at the Cleveland Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Conference. “But that approach and mindset would eliminate a key benefit of a stablecoin arrangement—that it serves as a viable competitor to banking organizations in their role as payment providers.” 

Waller told viewers to expect additional talks about cryptocurrency and DeFi regulation and policy in early 2022. ",3580150,Fed Gov Waller: Most Crypto Has Zero Value and is Not a Threat Fed Governor Waller believes that bitcoin is an “electronic gold” and does not pose a threat to the financial system’s stability. @Casey Wagner,0,1.0,2021-11-20 02:30:55,NEGATIVE,0.9792146682739258

Give it to family, friends or just a random stranger. If you are reading this you are an earlier adopter and most likely you may know someone who is yet to get their toes wet in the space. Be like Satoshi and bring bitcoin to the ppl.
This past year we have seen more outside investors and institutions enter the crypto space more than any other time in our short history. We also now have more accessible platforms and exchanges that makes owning bitcoin that much easier. 
Giving the gift of bitcoin can help bridge some of the learning curve and may actually change someones life for the better like it has done for probably most of the current users. 
Giving away bitcoin will also help foster more wide scale acceptance at a time when we are starting to bump up against regulations and laws. See Hillary Clinton.
 In the future Out of touch politicians may be more reluctant to pass harsh regulations if their voters and friends are now owners of bitcoin. 

Besides adoption a small amount of bitcoin now can change peoples lives. The 1200 dollar stimulus check may not have seemed like much but for a lot of people including myself it was just enough of a temporary relief that it let me expand outward.  With bitcoin you wont have to give that much to someone as long as you teach them how to properly hodl.

Besides gifts, I have set aside  crypto wallets as trusts to help fund the future education to my younger family members or to friends who now have children. 

Another personal project this past year is hiding crypto wallets while living the vanlife. The wallets have NFTs from various artists, alongside various coins. Kind of a Crypto GeoCache. Maybe one day someone will find a wallet and it can make a difference in their life. 

Anyways no matter where you see bitcoin going by the end of the year, It will mostly likely go up and now is the time to give bitcoin so people can watch the process for their-selves.

We all know that when we crate a cryptocurrency wallet, we must back up the wallet with the passphrase seed codes 12 or 24 words. or if you are printing a Paper Wallet for cold storage.

as regular pulp paper is frail and weak a simple glass of liquid can destroy your crypto permanently. 

For me it was a paper wallet that got damaged only $20 USD. nothing to cry about. 

that is why I started looking for a safer solution in form of paper for this problem for home ink based printers. And I didn’t find one on all the markets online and local.

so, I invented one.the invention was successfully accomplished in December 2020 after working on the invention for a couple of years, the paper name is **paperforcrypto** 

this is my way of being part of the mainstream adoption progress. Couple of years of my life and all the money i could scrape together for this project. when the global pandemic hit this project was as good as dead for me and this is how far I got by my self. I need help for the final step to start the production.

The smart city concept emerged in the past 15 years in the urban planning literature as descendant from the ""New Urbanism"" movement in the 1990s. So, by developing ‘smart infrastructure’ that can sense the activities around it, better and more efficient use of urban resources becomes possible. So far these have included transport, energy, lighting, security, communications, and other assets relating to the movement and coordination of people, information and resources, and assets whether commercial or public. A smart city can thus be a more energy efficient city, a city with better logistics and transport, better public services, a more legible and navigable city, and a city with better measures on a raft of other factors that affect the quality of city life. The smart city rationale thus seeks to invest in embedding digital sensing technology and computational processing into more and more of the city.

Critics of the smart city agenda point out that it requires data to be processed from a central coordination point, either by local government or contracted vendors. 

While the internet was developed as a decentralized system, it has developed centralizing tendencies. Transactions conducted over internet protocols (TCP, HTTP, transmission control protocol; hypertext transmission protocol) require external verification through third parties such as banks and governments, who retain large stores of information. Users of the internet interact with large conglomerates when performing search, social media, cloud storage, and other activities, agreeing to provide companies with access to the data they generate in the process. Smart cities depend on open systems of data governance. Existing ‘open data’ models however, are coordinated around the collection, processing (washing, de-identifying, packaging), and release of data by central government entities and institutions. The data gathered is from “smart devices” like phones, cameras, laptops, GPS units, monitors, RFIDs, televisions, tv set top boxes… you name it.

This is why (and how), Banks and Governments are able to “control” the internet and online transactions.

Blockchain is known as a value-exchange protocol, because it enables the automated transfer of value across digital networks without the need for third parties. Blockchains are distributed, in that they use a combination of encryption and peer-to-peer technology to update a common and immutable record to show when a transaction has occurred. All nodes within the system will synchronize to display the outcome. For example, when one party sends a cryptocurrency to another party, the amount will be subtracted from the sender’s wallet and added to the receiver’s wallet. The blockchain is updated to show the new balance of the two wallets or accounts within a chain of historical transactions, resulting in a distributed ledger that can be trusted without any external verification. Today’s blockchain platforms use incentive mechanisms for security and to ensure the validity of the record; those who participate by computationally verifying transactions are rewarded for their participation, usually in the form of cryptocurrency (issuing block rewards derived from transaction fees). Therefore, Banks and Governments, in this kind of scenario are not needed. 

As more and more information traded between people, shops, retailers goes through and is verified by the blockchain rather than a Bank or a Government body, the control shifts from a central power to a decentralised network – therefore creating a “Crypto City”.

A Quantum city is an evolution of a “Smart city” with faster but still centralised control. Google reached quantum supremacy as they want to collect data at hyper speeds to understand and monetize consumer behaviour. Everything online goes through Google servers and furnishes them with free information. 

A public blockchain avoids this central control. 

I say a “Crypto City” is a better evolution of technology for the human race rather than faster and faster (Quantum) and still centralised systems.

Then I transferred the funds from two of my wallets to the account using a mixer. I haven't logged into the account for a while, and when I needed to log in to see the address of my bitcoin wallet and make another transaction, to my surprise I could not do it. I got a message that the account is locked and I need to contact the administration.

Now to the most interesting part:

Openmailbox.org, the email service where I had an account to which I registered my Spectrocoin account, starts having problems and then just stops working altogether (more than a year has passed and it’s still ‘server under maintenance’ there). At first I at least could log in and receive letters, but could not send them (it gave an error message). I messaged the spectrocoin admins about my locked account on their website, but they said they’d only respond to a letter from the registered email address. Obviously, with my little Openmailbox problem I could not do it, but I sent them screenshots of the letter I typed in my registered Openmailbox account as well as a screenshot of the sending error which appeared after I tried to send it. Since then we’ve been communicating through another email address. 

At the moment what I know is this: 

1. Someone tried to hack my account by providing different identification (according to the spectrocoin admins) 

2. I went through the verification process again, including a video call.

3. I provided all requested identification and documents. Both as scans and on video.

4. I have my username and password from both the email account and the account on spectrocoin.

5. I DO NOT remember the wallet number on the locked account because my only interaction with it was cntrl v - cntrl c and sending btc.

6. I KNOW from which wallets I sent funds to it. If I wasn't the account’s rightful owner, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE to find out this information since the funds were sent through the mixer.

7. I sent receipts for the btc purchase.

8. + a number of other odd documents requested by the Spectrocoin administration.

About two years have passed since my Spectrocoin account (with all my money) was locked, yet the admins still refuse to unlock it. They say the documents I provided are insufficient, though they themselves told me which documents they needed and I did send everything on their list.

I ask: tell me what EXACTLY you need for me to provide and solve the problem, but they do not reply. They also do not respond to my request to send me a physical copy of a letter with their refusal to unlock my account, which I can take to court. 

Has anyone had or heard about having similar problems with Spectrocoin? Can anyone advise what to do in this case?

In a concrete example this is what market fundamentalism is and comes from Adam Smith from a time different to our own.

In reality, if you let financial things work out on their own, what will happen is that a small group of people will hold the majority of the assets and will change the rules such that they can keep it. This happened in the Middle East during Abbasid rule (800-1000 AD), in Italy (1300-1500) and Belgium (1500-1600)*. To see a more recent example, a very firm link is well known between the Reagen’s deregulation in the US during the 1980s and the financial crisis in 2008.

Moreover (and please correct me if Im wrong) if the world ran on bitcoin, wouldn’t it give massive stimulus to criminal activity? It feels like people love how “there is no middle man” but doesn’t seem to understand that the middleman doesn’t just charge you money, they do other things like checking if you are dodgy or not, and even pay your money back if they steal your card. Have we understood all the benefits of centralisation that we forgo and (more broadly) is decentralisation ALWAYS a good idea in EVERY respect of our lives?

I know there were some political factors involved but also wondering, were there any neutral, technical reason?

From what I learned recently, which I may be totally wrong, these are some possible reasons:

1. Increased block size would make running full node require more hardware resources thus make bitcoin more centralized. But why? Wasn't the initial proposal just to double the block size from 1mB to 2mB? Also isn't it that what miners and nodes need are just some more storage space? Why this amount of increase would affect?
2. Increasing the block size would be just a temporary solution. As more people using bitcoin, the block size would never be enough, and we would eventually need other solutions like layer 2 or sidechain, and why not just use them? But why that some protocols can simply increase the block size and have not run into scalability issue without SegWit or sidechain or Layer 2. Or is it just because their scales are not large enough?
3. Hard fork is too hard for bitcoin as there were already so many nodes and miners running the program. I think this might be a reasonable reason? Since the developers would also want to keep the bitcoin's value, hard fork would definitely create new coins and make bitcoin less valuable?

But in the middle of it the Chinese bubble bursts, due to the global economic slowdown. this creates a global crisis but bitcoin continues its climb towards a million dollars. Largely because of Russia who started buying bitcoin. the US bans bitcoin alleging money laundering. American miners go to other countries and coinbase has its cryptocurrencies confiscated. Customers have their cryptocurrencies confiscated in exchange for IOUS that pay income in crypto dollars. All this generated panic that made the  bitcoin prices to plummet 60% trading today at 400k. Several cryptocurrencies have dropped 80-90%.

His 1992 novel [Snow Crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) coined the phrase ""Metaverse"" and his 1999 novel [Cryptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon) as well as his 1995 short story [The Great Simoleon Caper](https://www.electricinca.com/56/stephenson/simoleon.pdf) include many themes familiar to us here.

During the Q&amp;A Neal repeated one question: ""What has been your experience learning about bitcoin?""

I was interested to hear Neal indicate that:

1. He holds one bitcoin.  He has friends that find it crazy he doesn't own more.

2. He is more interested in the application of blockchain to novel forms of organization and smart contracts than its application to money.

3. He is aware of altcoins, ICOs, and other aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem but admittedly has not yet focused on researching bitcoin specifically.

Earlier the library director aptly introduced Neal as an renowned author and polymath, and Neal humbly said he would do his best to live up to that reputation. His subsequent introduction to his latest book had a powerpoint presentation with a slide picturing an El Salvadoran volcano.  This was unrelated to bitcoin, but mentioned in the context of past volcanic eruptions affecting the degree of solar radiation penetrating Earth's troposphere (a subject of his latest book).

Another good question asked later was about Neal's technical writing process, to which he answered that he begins writing with pen on paper, making edits when they occur to him.  Neal said he finds this faster than computer interfaces and appreciates the edit history visibility. When he eventually types in a manuscript with finishing touches it is more or less the final product.

I admire and enjoy Neal Stephenson and his books, and I wonder if he might have some future ""Eureka"" moment that makes bitcoin more interesting to him as author or user.  I am still certainly excited to read his latest book [Termination Shock](https://www.nealstephenson.com/termination-shock.html).

These are my facts:

* I wrote ""Tqbfjotld. - Sentence"" on the sheet where my paper wallets were stored - reminding myself that the password was: ""**The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox.**"" with the ""T"" underlined three times, telling me that letter was capitalized.
* I don't think I did anything special, like **backwards, cHaNgE oF fOnT sIzE, numeric, special, or non-special characters** \- I genuinely remember myself thinking no one was going to guess that password anyways if it were a sentence.

A previously established level of support or resistance may therefore become an anchor at which points future resistance or support will be observed - even though these points may not reflect any fundamentals. Likewise, round numbers such as $1,000 or $25,000 may serve as support or resistance levels, not because they are fundamentally-driven, but are symbolically meaningful as psychological anchors. As these levels are breached, traders may adjust their anchors accordingly.

Having been investing only since early 2020 in stocks and late 2020 in crypto.

I've been lucky and have dabbled in both short-term, swing-trading, and long-term investing.

I would say I am mostly grateful for the youtubers who do their research and share with me the wisdom and knowledge I need to execute my future trades.

However, lately, I have been quite annoyed when they use the term ""don't be afraid to take profits"" or ""I took profits from coin A and put it in coin B""

Perhaps this is all semantics, but I take pride in being convicted in a certain stock or coin and sticking to it no matter what. My thought process is that if indeed you ""don't know what the market will do in the short-term"" and you warn me that ""crypto is very volatile"" then what are you really saying when you ""take profits"" on a whim and load up on the next shiny coin. I mean how convicted were you in a coin in the first place? And why do you say ""I took some profits"" like you want a pat on the back or something.

It's like you want to be admired for selling at the top when you seldom tell us when you sell at the bottom. ""Don't be afraid to take profits""

To be honest, I don't get it.

Yes, I myself do short-term trades all the time. And get lucky more times than not.

But I wouldn't ever boast about it. It's purely speculation and gambling.

So all this to say, please enlighten me. What am I missing here?

Is there a science to the ""daytraders"" of crypto?

Is ""taking profits"" an accurate term for swing trading with coins?

 I have a question that I have not been able to solve on my own with the research I have done so far.

first some context-  I am an artist both digital and analog and I have sold pieces for both bitcoin and ETH (pre-NFT boom) and these art transactions I have participated have been face to face with patrons of mine. I find the current dapp environment to be unattractive to me because I find that it has the same effect as the tshirt and art print industry. It approaches the problem of financial viability with volume rather than higher value pieces.    
I have been working with artists who are geographically close to me because maintaining a strong physical presence is still valuable but what I look to do is to find creative solutions to allow the amateur artists I mentor to bridge their experience with art into the new space of smart contracts and digital trade and bartering. 

With that said, has anyone found any useful tools, apps, or maybe some reading material that would present some possible solutions? I am interested in growing my own experience with digital/crypto patronage as a proof of concept to give example to my mentorees and students and learning how to transition to a new evolving commerce model myself would be a great model to share.

While this great technology is catching mainstream attention and more people are HODLing bitcoin now, it is important to stress the importance of security. 

No one else but you are responsible for keeping it safe so take the time to learn about the various things that can be done to enhance its security. I am sharing a few measures that I have learned with time and shared with many people in the past,

**Use Hardware Wallet:** 

Cold wallets are currently one of the safest ways to store your bitcoin. Invest in a hardware wallet and store your bitcoin in them. 

**Store your Private Keys/Wallet Seed Offline and Never Share Them**

There is a very common saying in the bitcoin world:

&gt;*Not your Keys, Not your Bitcoin*

This basically means that if you do not own the private keys you don’t own that bitcoin. The proof of ownership with Bitcoin lies in the *private keys* of your wallet/address, thus keeping it safe is of utmost importance.

Keep your private seeds/keys offline. 

**Never Store your Bitcoin on Exchanges**

Given exchanges are the prime target of most hackers it is always advised to use exchanges only for making the trade but never for storing. Once the desired trade is made, withdraw your bitcoin and any other crypto and keep it in your personal wallet.

**Keep Backup**

While storing your private keys/Seed for your wallet, it is always a good idea to keep backup.

**Use separate wallets for daily use and savings**

While storing bitcoin, it is never a good idea to store all your bitcoin in one place. Split them into different wallets and categorize them for *daily use, savings, trading, etc.* This way if one wallet gets compromised the rest of your bitcoin is safe. 

**Never click or access unverified bitcoin links**

This goes without saying but, avoid clicking any unverified links claiming to be investment opportunities, bitcoin giveaways, or anything similar asking for your private keys or asking you to send bitcoin.

\- Regardless of whether the user sends the requested documents, Localbitcoins does not respond for a longer period of time (the record is half a year !!!) and the locked bitcoins cannot be accessed for a longer period of time.

I was curious at what point it becomes as big of a network in terms of volume as some financial household names.

It's important to note that I'm not talking about replacing Mastercard or Visa. Bitcoin is more of a ""savings technology"" rather than a ""spending (more than you have) technology"". It's not only technically very different, but caters to different uses.

With that said, let's take a look at the 2021 quarterly volumes:

|Network|Average quarterly volume in 2021|
|:-|:-|
|Bitcoin|$489 billion|
|PayPal|$302 billion|
|Mastercard|$1.8 trillion|
|Visa|$3.2 trillion|

In graph form, looking back a bit further:

[Bitcoin's data sourced from blockchain.com's estimated btc tx volume in USD, the others from their respective quarterly reports](https://preview.redd.it/bep782zpzj181.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4d73dcb6eebb060ff82ca9b34c05595e215db80)

Bitcoin basically needs to grow its volume by 260% to be on par with Mastercard and 540% to be on par with Visa in terms of volume. While that doesn't sound like much, it is a lot.

There are 3 factors that could get Bitcoin to such levels:

1. The number of transactions rises.
2. The average amount of bitcoin sent per transaction rises.
3. The bitcoin price rises.

Factor #1 is likely to be (part of) the answer, but is technically complex to determine due to the privacy provided by scalability solutions such as the Lightning Network. I go more in-depth on this in [the full article](https://www.blockdata.tech/blog/general/bitcoin-volume-mastercard-visa).

As for factor #2 &amp; 3: There is an unsurprising inverse correlation between the bitcoin price and the average btc sent per transaction. This means that as the bitcoin price goes up, the average btc that is transferred goes down.

[Data sourced from blockchain.com](https://preview.redd.it/kwv8f8a20k181.png?width=3468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf75cbfaed6f546a7f5d96e4e8b91409e85309ed)

If the Bitcoin blockchain eventually becomes more of a settlement layer, while payments increasingly move to solutions built on top of it such as the Lightning Network, then we could see this trend reverse.

Until such a time, the bitcoin price would need to rise substantially more than 260% for the processed volume to be at Mastercard level. However, taking this inverse correlation into account would complicate the model and still not account for many other potential factors such as increased inflation, new technological breakthroughs, corporate or sovereign adoption, etc.

If we just take the 260% as an indicator however, and plot out 3 basic growth trends (that have no guarantee by any means to continue in their path of course), then you arrive at a time range of 2026-2060s for the Bitcoin network to process an equivalent to that of the Mastercard network. If the price were to grow at the minimum price increase per year rate, it would stay on par with the Mastercard network.

I go into a lot more stuff in the full article such as:

* the number of transactions processed by each network
* the amount of users on each network
* what kind of role layer 2 solutions can play
* how governments and central banks are driving people towards bitcoin through inflation

* Paper wallet  
They actually have a lot of flaws: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper\_wallet](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet#Redeeming_Keys_and_Withdrawing_Funds)
* Seed phrase on a metal card  
Which seed phrase standard? BIP39 or electrum? Will the software that I create seed phrase with still be supported after 18 years? What's the best software to generate seed phrase with? Should I backup the SW itself on some pendrive? If I happen to have more than 1 outgoing transaction, does restoring a wallet from seed phrase also restore change addresses (I don't know too much about those TBH)
* Hardware wallet  
So kind of seed phrase with extra steps ;). Way I see it, the HW wallet would essentially generate a seed phrase and perhaps make withdrawal a bit easier if it's still supported 18 years from now. But I'm not that sure if it adds any benefit over using just a seed phrase.

So I am writing this so that I can link it as a warning to the newbies coming in. 

There are 2 main options for bitcoin 
First option; use bitcoin as a savings account. Dollar cost average in or buy the dips, never sell for depreciating fiat but spend when needed. This is what I and many others do, and it is a winning long term formula. 

Second option, trading aka timing the market. Many people can trade up their position doing this; but please do your research - so many think they can beat the market by watching YouTube videos and Twitter (or asking Reddit). Most amateurs spend hours doing this just to lose a huge chunk of their portfolio. You’re not only up against expert traders and whales, but also tax. 
For example, let’s say you read every trading book and want to outsmart the market and plan to sell top and rebuy on a dip. Say you sell one bitcoin for 200k that you bought for 10k, with the plan to rebuy at 100k.
In the unlikely event you outsmarted the market; you sold one bitcoin for 200, set aside 60k for tax, rebuy 1.4 bitcoin in 6 months. But what if you aren’t smarter than the market (or a spot etf is approved, or another large company announcement, or another country adopts bitcoin as legal tender) and you end up rebuying at 280k, your one bitcoin is now 0.5 bitcoin (or 140k of stocks with a current cape ratio of 40) https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)

After a six-month hiatus, Bitcoin hit another record high of $67,000, setting up the possibility of reaching $100,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin has pulled back slightly after hitting a new high on Oct. 20 and has fallen out of $60,000 as of the 27th Oct.

People have been used to the rise of Bitcoin. whether it goes up to $20,000, $60,000 or $100,000. People don’t seem to be too surprised by its fluctuations, simply thinking that expectations have landed because the crypto market has become a part of people’s lives.

Some people are confident about this new all-time high for Bitcoin, and some trading analysts believe that Bitcoin is in full bull mode as the on-chain metrics look promising.

However, some others believe that what is driving bitcoin to record highs is inflationary concerns. They still think bitcoin is a highly speculative asset class. And they cannot understand what is happening in the cryptocurrency market.

The market clearly has different views on the subsequent direction of Bitcoin and even the crypto market.

**Why did the price of bitcoin skyrocket in October?**

**1:Medium and long-term holders reached a new high in the past two years, and the long-term holders reached an all-time high.**

From Glassnode, the percentage of supply holding coins for more than 3 months and longer is now over 85%, which is a new high in the last two years. A shift from weak to strong hands is also emerging, with investors willing to hold for longer and longer periods.

Previously there was a period of downturn in bitcoin under the crackdown of Chinese policies. But as the market stabilized, the influence of policy crackdowns became progressively less. In addition, foreign interest rate hikes were seen as impossible to come in the short term, and the overall environment was better, which also formed a long-term investor impact reaching all-time highs.

**2:Bitcoin Futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) Hype**

The first U.S. bitcoin futures ETF officially landed on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 19 EST, with a first-day turnover of nearly $1 billion, the second-highest record in history.

This will also allow for a more mature and liquid crypto market, as well as bring a higher level of attention.

**3:Bitcoin’s Anti-Inflation Rate**

JPMorgan Chase published a research report last week stating that investors are pulling out of gold ETFs and into bitcoin funds. Analysts at JPMorgan believe that bitcoin is considered a better inflation hedge than gold and is the main reason for the current rally, triggering a shift from gold ETFs to bitcoin funds since September.

**4:Miners’computing power gradually recovered**

After experiencing a massive transfer of Chinese miners and their going overseas, as well as continued efforts from overseas mining vendors, bitcoin mining difficulty has rebounded by up to 45.5% since late July, and network-wide arithmetic power is gradually recovering. The recovery of arithmetic power is a strong reflection and guarantee for the security and strong consensus of the Bitcoin network.

&gt;***Bull market may continue while bearish risks still need attention***

Despite Bitcoin’s record high, Bitcoin’s biggest negative point still lies in regulatory policy. In this round, the U.S. approved Bitcoin futures ETF, not spot ETF, in the hope that under a strong and mature futures ETF regulatory mechanism, the government will bring a big negative to Bitcoin if it implements strong cryptocurrency regulation.

Similarly analyst Barry also said that the data on the chain also shows that the bull market has not reached the peak stage yet. Long-term holders are still holding large positions and not selling on a large scale, so the price has not yet peaked.

**However, it is important to note that some of the long-term holders have already started to realize profits (selling) and the risk in the market is starting to increase.**

If you are willing to redeem your bitcoins, write to me and you can redeem it for 1 oz of each precious metal in the title plus 1,000 units of each of the fiat currencies mentioned. I will ship it to anywhere in the world you would like me to, at no extra cost. 

The offer is valid for any bitcoin amount. The assets will be sent upon transaction confirmation. The fiat currencies must be sent electronically however as some countries restrict parcels with cash inside, so you must provide a bank account information. You can also accept the fiat currencies value in any of the precious metals to avoid any bank transfer issue. Gold is my favorite, but not a problem if you prefer silver or platinum.

Similarly to when we lived in a gold standard, this redeeming window can be closed under extremely unusual circumstances. No one questioned the trueness of the gold standard back then for that, so no one should question my basket-of-assets standard for that now.

## Paytm Open to Bitcoin Offerings

Paytm Chief Financial Officer Madhur Deora has indicated that his company is open to offering bitcoin services if the crypto asset becomes legal in India, local media reported Thursday, citing his recent interview with Bloomberg TV.

Deora was quoted as saying:

Bitcoin is still in a regulatory grey area if not a regulatory ban in India. At the moment Paytm does not do bitcoin. If it was ever to become fully legal in the country, then clearly there could be offerings we could launch.

In August last year, Paytm reportedly froze Paytm Payments Bank’s customer accounts suspected of crypto trading.

Paytm is currently India’s second most-valuable internet company. The company is planning to launch an initial public offering (IPO) between Nov. 8 and Nov. 10. The IPO, which is expected to take the company’s valuation to $20 billion, is poised to become the biggest IPO in the history of the Indian capital markets.

The Indian government has been working on a cryptocurrency bill for quite some time. Initially, the government was considering a bill to ban cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin. However, recent reports suggest that the government is now planning to regulate the crypto sector. The crypto legislation will be “distinct and unique,” one lawmaker said. Last month, Finance Ministry officials reportedly said that crypto regulation would most likely come around by February.

Meanwhile, the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), still has “serious concerns” about cryptocurrency, which have been communicated to the government. The RBI also said that a digital rupee model may be unveiled by the end of the year.",3513894,"Indian Payments Giant Paytm Could Offer Bitcoin Services if Government Makes Crypto Legal, Says CFO",0,1.0,2021-11-05 08:19:34,NEGATIVE,0.9963447451591492

I have been playing with this in my head and I don't really know what conclusion to draw. I'm curious to hear some of your thoughts, as I lay this out. 

Generally, a yield curve describes the yield on bonds with a similar risk profile for different maturities. The normal yield curve is upwards sloping, as locking in capital for a longer period of time is associated with a higher risk, thus investors demand a higher risk premium. Now if the yield curve inverts, investors perceive the near future more risky than the far future, hence demanding a higher risk premium on short term bonds than on longer term bonds. Hence, an inverted yield curve has been one of the most reliable indicators for a looming recession. This is common knowledge and has been true for every recession in the last century (as seen below on the most commonly used spread between 2 and 10 year US treasury yields).  


This is somewhat tied to the idea of a at least semi-efficient market hypothesis, generally describing the fact that the knowledge of all market participants is priced in. Hence, the market sees the recession coming and prices in the perceived short term risk due to looming recession into short term bonds, hence inverting the yield curve.  


Now my question: How far do you think does this game-theoretic  act of ""pricing in"" go. Meaning, in a time were the FED usually tries to raise interest rate, sees the S&amp;P crashing and then once again goes back to 0% fed funds rate and QE. Does the market ""learn this trick""? Meaning does the market by know know that the FED might try to raise IR but always reverts back to zero? How would that be priced in? Does the inverted yield curve signal still work? Technically I am asking: Does the market learn the pattern: recession looms --&gt; FED lowers IR and does QE --&gt; prices go to infinity.  


The easy answer (and a core mentality of every Bitcoiner) here is obviously that the FED messes up all kinds of price and market signals through massive QE. Still, I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.

As we make our way into 2022, our high expectations continue, edging closer to fruition. Continuous outflows of BTC on exchanges, increasing numbers of long-term bitcoin holders, 50,000 new bitcoin entities per day, and an overall ever-expanding network that bitcoin continues to create; all contributing to the development, demand and success of bitcoin. 

However, after weeks of analysis, I believe we as individuals should be doing everything possible to empower bitcoin. I have determined that reducing the supply of bitcoin is one thing that we can do to increase the demand for bitcoin. This is why I propose we all send any arbitrary amount of bitcoin to the unknown address below,  Where your Bitcoins can disappear from the circulating supply forever; ultimately contributing to the scarcity of bitcoin.

Basically it would be in the spirit of this Twitter video that shows what the effect of buying 1 USD of bitcoin a day vs. saving 1 USD a day from 2015 to 2020.               

https://twitter.com/JamesTodaroMD/status/1223670320541900800?t=AxoeQvyc_7zExP24uRYilw&amp;s=19                

Details: obviously I'm not going to put 1 dollar on bitcoin every single day as a day goes by, because then you have to pay the exchange's fee, taker fees, maker fees, etc.             

The general plan:              
1. On the 5th of every month I will buy 30 or 31 USD of bitcoin, depending on how many days were in the previous month. This is obviously subject to price fluctuations.                
2. I will post the USD value of the lightning wallet that I use, not the exchange.                 
3. In the interest of privacy, I will **not** post the transaction IDs.             
4. I will post withdrawal fees if/when necessary. I don't plan on withdrawing anything if I think the amount is too low - that's just making sure the exchange eats your profits.                

So, starting today I will purchase 31 USD of bitcoin and then I'll keep you guys posted on profits / losses from this month forward. If you guys think I'm forgetting something, don't hesitate to ping me.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Bretton-Woods agreement happened, the legacy finance system we know today was set in motion, and all global currencies were to be pegged to the US dollar with exchange rates set. This, combined with the removal of the gold standard, set in motion an inflationary economy based on a simple principle:   


Infinite growth based on the exploitation of finite resources.

&amp;#x200B;

Logic dictates this will fail. Not if, but when.  


The rest of the world was duped into believing that ""by decree"" US dollars were valuable. See also, [fiat](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).  
Now, [fractional reserve banking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5xDzTvW6E) combined with Fed QE is eroding the dollar faster than ever.   


Many people that want safe haven assets use real estate, with a philosophy that there will only ever be a certain amount of inhabitable property or land on this planet, and while the number of people in the world continues to grow exponentially, the demand for such product will increase over time and become more valuable with a larger number of individuals competing for a finite amount of that resource. Supply and demand.  


Now, papa Elon and others have plans to take us off-world. I believe there is a greater than 0 probability that people will be able to buy real estate on other planets within my lifetime (I'm 31). I'm not saying that is super likely for the average person, but there is a greater than zero probability.   


With the fixed supply of BTC written into the code, there is a 0 probability that more BTC will ever be produced beyond 21 million. There is an almost certain probability that someone, somewhere, at some point in the future will lose their keys. That just makes everyone else's coin worth more as Satoshi pointed out in the BTC whitepaper. BTC is the only mathematically verifiable, cryptographically secure, finite resource in the known universe.  


According to Savills, the total value locked in the global real estate market was $326.5 trillion in 2020.  
Offshore financial havens are said to hold up to $36 trillion in cash, gold, and securities.   


As the US Government continues to overspend and inflate the US dollar, and global confidence continues to decline, all of this capital is going to begin to look at alternative places to be stored.   


We are still so early.

Roughly every four years, the amount of new coins being created is halved - an event called the *halving*. The idea is that a **reduction of new Bitcoins created combined with increased demand leads to higher prices**. This is why Bitcoin is often described as being deflationary by design.

For a more vivid comparison, imagine what would happen to the price of gold if half of the world’s gold mines collapse every four years. This comparison has its merits because Bitcoin is often described as a store of value (SoV), a property commonly assigned to gold. A prevalent model to be considered in this context is Plan B’s Stock To Flow Model. It compares Bitcoin’s stock, the size of the existing stockpiles or reserves of Bitcoin, and its flow, the yearly production, to commodities such as gold or silver. The model continues to hold up well and strengthens the arguments for halving events to have a considerable impact on the price of Bitcoin.

A halving event kicked off a Bitcoin bull run in 2012 and 2016. Most analysts would agree that we are currently in one as well. How this cycle is going to play out is where analysts begin to have controversial discussions. One idea is that Bitcoin is nowadays more established, has garnered more institutional investors, and is an attractive inflation hedge. This belief is referred to as being in a Bitcoin “supercycle” / “the last cycle” and implies that we will see less of a price pullback than the previous cycles have had.

The other belief is that we will experience another sharp price uptake before reaching a peak followed by a spectacular price drop, a so-called blow-off top, just like the 2012 and 2016 cycles have had. Regardless of how the price of Bitcoin will develop, the best thing you can do to prepare is to think through what both scenarios would mean for you.

Background: The problem of data brokerage industry
For years the data brokerage industry has been completely broken. Over $200 Billion of data is exchanged each year in an unfair and non-transparent way. But consumers, who are actually driving the industry do not share in the benefits. 

To solve this problem, Insights Network built a scalable, verified account based blockchain system that powers the instars.com application. Users who have accounts, will be paid when they're targeted by surveyors and advertisers on the instars.com platform. Each time a user adds additional profile values about themselves to their profile, they earn the network cryptocurrency, instar, in exchange for their data. Unlike Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, the instars.com platform is a fully verified user base, eliminating advertising fraud such as bots or spam from clicking ads, watching paid videos, or spreading fake news from false identities. This makes reaching real users and spending advertising dollars far more efficient and cost effective. For the user, for the first time in internet history, they will be rewarded for the data they're generating in the network!

In the report, JP Morgan predicts that Bitcoin could rise to $146,000 in the long term if Bitcoin volatility diminishes and institutions begin to prefer Bitcoin to gold in their portfolios.

&amp;#x200B;

JP Morgan believes that bitcoin is competing with gold for investors' attention as a hedge against inflation. The bank also believes that bitcoin is also a scarce product, meaning that it will rise even as inflation erodes the value of other assets.

&amp;#x200B;

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan, said, ""There seems to be renewed interest in buying bitcoin as a hedge against inflation as investors' concerns about inflation resurfaced in September and October this year. In particular, gold has failed to respond to inflation expectations in recent weeks, which has strengthened the appeal of bitcoin as an inflation hedge.""

&amp;#x200B;

Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou added that given the younger generation's preference for cryptocurrencies, the competition between cryptocurrencies and gold is set to continue as they gradually start investing. ""Given the sheer size of gold's investment, any outflow from gold to cryptocurrencies implies a lot of long-term upside for bitcoin.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, JP Morgan also noted that for Bitcoin to achieve its long-term price target of $146,000, then its volatility would have to fall significantly. The bank noted that bitcoin is about four to five times more volatile than gold, and volatility would have to fall significantly as institutional investors flock to the space.

&amp;#x200B;

The bank noted that bitcoin volatility would have to fall sharply before institutional investors would flock to the space.

How could it possibly hit the target that everybody seems to be talking about, namely the moon?

Models may work to a certain extent, but this is an entirely new type of economy with complexities far in excess of what happened when gold was a thing. 

That said, you don’t want to read a post which just says the same old “your capital is at risk” in another roundabout way. You want some reassurance, some kind of certainty.

Well you can’t have it as such, but you can make your own reality because that is all you really ever have. Whatever you do, make sure you make your own decisions. Let your opinion not be the opinion of other people, because he will just make their mistakes. Paragraph whether you win or lose when this is done, the only thing that really matters is whether you made your decisions with a level of research that satisfied you, and you went with decisions that were entirely your own.

Whilst we’re on that note, fuck your feelings. They will destroy your better judgement, especially if you try to use them to determine your behaviour in the short term.

You can't see it because you are not thinking in the right terms.

As an example, almost every politician in history looked at statistics. He is not looking at you, he looks at a statistic and if this statistic in your state or country tells about narrow minded Christian/Muslim w/e hard liners he will evaluate this, act and say things accordingly to the preposition. If the narrative shifts, he will shift his facts slowly, to not loose the hardliners, but surely.

If this is something new to you and you did not think about it hard and clear, this will frighten you or you will dismiss it.

The truth is, most people don't think about reality as it is, they think about their individual reality and this individual reality doesn't mirror the true reality. The true reality, a huge planet an ever-expanding universe were so many things go on that describe reality, is almost impossible to get the full picture of.

What political players take for their advantage is money and statistics. Statistics tell you everything about every state, every country, every city, every suburban small fracture and then these statistics put you as an individual in a broad place.

When you think as an individual, try to abandon the main principle of this narrow thought process.  You.

If you do not think broad space, you don't think at all.

And if the politician does not think about reality this way or takes these principles into consideration – do you really want her or him to govern you?

As a result, even though the cryptocurrency market, led by Bitcoin, has soared in market value, it has been slow to gain recognition from the traditional financial industry, and national financial market regulators have not issued a formal ETF product for over a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

This situation continued until February 18th of this year, when Canada fired the first shot - the Toronto Exchange, which launched the world's first ETF (TIP) in 1990, launched CAD ETF Non-Currency, the world's first Purpose Bitcoin ETF for investing in bitcoin Hedged Units (TSX:BTCCb), and in the month that followed, Bitcoin followed suit, soaring from just over $40,000 to over $60,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Subsequently, related cryptocurrency ETFs began to spring up on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada, including three ethereum ETFs - the Purpose Ether ETF (ETHH), the CI Galaxy Ethereum ETF (ETHX) and the Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR)', and another Bitcoin ETF - 3iQCoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ).

&amp;#x200B;

However, what is more exciting for the market is that on 19 October this year, Wall Street finally welcomed the first Bitcoin ETF - the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE:BITO).

The ProShares Bitcoin Strategic Futures ETF (BITO) was extremely popular on its launch day, with first-day volume exceeding $32.52 million and the spot price of bitcoin soaring to a high of $66,017.7 at one point. Less than half a month after its listing, BITO has already grown to become the second largest bitcoin ETF in the world in terms of market capitalisation after the 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ).

&amp;#x200B;

The market's enthusiasm for investing in bitcoin and ethereum is high, and the listing of a series of cryptocurrency ETFs such as BITO on Wall Street has further boosted the market's sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

Statistics show that the cryptocurrency market has seen inflows of around $8 billion so far this year, surpassing last year's $6.7 billion, and the entire cryptocurrency market now has a market cap of over $2 trillion. the week of BITO's IPO, the total assets managed and invested in crypto by various investment houses had reached $76.7 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, with the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, both open interest and trading volume in Chicagoland BTC futures reached record highs, according to the latest data from Glassnode, spurring an explosive rise in open interest in October, increasing by $3.95 billion (265%) as the BITO ETF utilised Chicagoland futures contracts as the underlying, setting a new record high for open interest in CME exchange futures closed positions at a new all-time high of US$5.44 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, trading volume also reached a new high of $7.66 billion on 20 October, the day Bitcoin reached an all-time high. Traders traded $490 million more on CME futures relative to the previous peak set in February 2021. However, the margin ratio for futures collateralised by volatile cryptocurrency assets continues to fall, with futures contracts collateralised by cryptocurrencies having fallen from 70.1% in April (at the time of Coinbase's listing) to 44.6% today.

&amp;#x200B;

As the market continues its frenzy, investors still need to be aware of the risk factors in the cryptocurrency market.

&amp;#x200B;

SEC Chairman Gary Gensler ""poured cold water"" on the launch of the first bitcoin ETF when he said that the cryptocurrency market was growing at a rapid pace, but that additional regulation was still needed to ensure that investors' rights were protected. He said outright that the current cryptocurrency market still has insufficient protection mechanisms for investors, suggesting that the SEC still has no plans to release a bitcoin spot ETF in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, investments in cryptocurrency ETFs have their own shortcomings, with some investors complaining that futures-based ETFs cannot track bitcoin perfectly due to the cost of buying and selling futures contracts and other issues. They believe that if the cryptocurrency continues to rise, investors in bitcoin futures ETFs may face the problem of the fund lagging behind in performance.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) closed 2.24% lower last week at $60,460 per coin so far, according to quotes from Invesco [Investing.com](https://Investing.com). In addition, the CME November contract for bitcoin futures at the ChiNext is currently trading at $60,815, having also lost 0.55% on a weekly basis last week.",3501811,"Bitcoin ETF continues to drive market enthusiasm: less than half a month after listing, market cap already exceeds $1 billionWhat do you think about that just for reference",0,1.0,2021-11-02 11:31:09,NEGATIVE,0.9568543434143066

The project aims at replicating most aspects of the current political system while shifting the source of power. 

We are also going to address common pitfalls of both the current system and direct democracy.

- Majoritarianism (mob rule)

The majority is not required to participate in the political process. There are also instruments that allow the minority to shield itself such as credit default swaps on sovereign debt.

- Itemization of legislation 

Voting doesn't happen on the law by law basis rather on bundles of laws that are created by competing taxpayer funded entities.

- Voters may lack information 

Liquid democracy: voters can have an unlimited number of representatives that compete for taxpayer funding.

He then points out that bitcoin has no intrinsic value because it cannot be made into things like gold can.

Gold is TANGIBLE.  Thus, it makes sense that it's value-adding attribles are also tangible.  

Bitcoin is INTANGIBLE.  Obviously, if you try to find TANGIBLE goods to manufacture with it, you won't find any.

Just as bitcoin is intangible, it makes sense that it's unique value-adding attributes are also intangible.  No money before bitcoin could claim these intangible and useful attributes:
- Security ensured by mathematics (instead of guns).
- Borderless
- Final settlement in the same short time ANYWHERE
- permissionless
- non-reversable (good or bad depending on the context)
- Fully transparent ledger
- Censorship resistant

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know if there is a weekly or monthly limit?  Such as how much neteller/skrill can you convert to btc each day, or week or month etc?  I notice the fee they charge is 1.4% each way assuming you are doing at least 1,000 dollars.  The other confusing thing here is if you buy btc... the btc stays in your neteller account?  **Surely you could send it to your hardware wallet right?  That doesn't make any sense unless im readying it incorrectly? If so, what is the point of having btc in neteller then if you can't send the btc to your own wallet?**

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is what I would do back then and still now is trade my neteller/skrill with few people who I done lot of trades with for their boa/zelle.  These are people who are I traded with for a while.  So when I send them neteller/skrill, they trade me boa/zelle to my BoA checking account etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But since the people I trade with do not need any neteller/skrill at the moment now.... what is the best way for me to convert neteller/skrill to btc?  Are there sites that charge less than neteller?  I heard about forex exchanges but could that be done for this situation?

I’m not an economist and I would really like to read any comments or counter arguments.


Ending the Gold Standard

After the 1929 Great Depression, the US Federal government could not print enough money to pay for his spending program. All paper money had to be backed by 40 percent gold owned by the Federal to prevent bank runs. From 1933 to 1974, Executive order 6102 made it criminal in the US to own or trade gold coins or gold bullions. Every citizen had a month to turn in their gold to any member bank of the Federal Reserve or get penalties of 10 years imprisonment. During those times, people had to stop using gold and get used to paper money only.

Then in 1971, Nixon completely ended the gold standard due to large deficits by selling every oz of gold from the Federal reserve. The main expenses during those years was to finance wars and the US used their military supremacy to impose the dollar. Thus creating the biggest illusion of money yet created, the fiat standard, backed by nothing but authorities.

Gold ownership was legalized again a few years later.


Fiat is a scam

A scam is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of something.

In a fiat standard, governments have the power of devaluing their currency through money printing or quantitative easing. Basically, instead of directly taxing citizens, governments now have unlimited access to any saving accounts to pay for their deficits. Considering that wealthy people don’t have any fiat currency, this hidden tax primarily targets the working class, people trying to save money and those living on fixed incomes such as Social Security. Less educated/fortunate people that don’t have any assets might never realize the decline of their purchasing power.

Currently the smartest move to fight unpredictable inflation seems to get rid quickly of your fiat holdings and buy assets instead (and yet everything is nominated in fiat!).The biggest winners are the wealthy that can borrow large amounts of money to buy more assets or influence politics, for example petroleum industries which also protect the US dollar. This concentration of power in the hands of a few leads to abuse and printed fiat is constantly used for socializing losses on privatized gain investments of the wealthiest, like bank bailouts or subsidies to large corporations. Policies that individually we will never vote for them!
 

Conclusion

In 2009, Bitcoin concretized money again and broke the fiat illusion. Yet, history can repeat itself if we are not cautious. Don’t leave your holdings in exchanges/banks, avoid KYC, and do not buy derivatives like Bitcoin ETF. It’s important that people hold the real thing or else authorities might be able to make their own rules and print any amount of derivatives.

However, when it comes to exponential growth, we tend to overestimate the short-term impact and underestimate the long-term impact. Just as the dotcom bubble collapsed in 2000, the Internet went from being a game changer to being a hotbed of capital. It turns out that the Internet is not so magical, and most companies have not succeeded in building a worthwhile business model on the Internet. However, how many people can imagine that only a dozen years later, the Internet has profoundly changed the pattern of today's business society, but also changed our lives.

Like the development of the Internet, the rise of blockchain, a protocol-based, disruptive technology that requires large-scale collaboration and participation, will take longer than most people expect, and the ultimate scope and depth of impact will be far greater than most people imagine. The future development of blockchain will not be plain sailing. It may experience overheating or even bubble stage, and may also experience trough. However, I believe that blockchain, as the core technology of the next stage of the digital wave, will eventually build a diversified ecological value Internet, which will profoundly change the structure of the future business society and our lives

First, let's talk about currency speculation. Frankly speaking, it is a way to buy from the secondary market at a low price and then sell the currency to make profits when the price rises. Coin speculation is a high-risk, high-return investment. Because the current currency price is high, investment speculation requires a lot of capital investment, the threshold is too high. Ordinary investors do not have the financial capacity to play the risk - averse game. And must always pay attention to policy guidance, pay close attention to market trends, afraid of missing a sickle and afraid of cutting leeks. The market is not very stable now, the pricing power is always in the hands of the dealer. You do not know when to go up, when to fall, accidentally cut leek. No one can buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point. What we can do is gradually improve our level and outperform most people.

Coinbase account defi liquidity mining is equivalent to quantitative investment, an investment, long-term returns, and produce a certain amount of money every day, and revenue stream, because the mining and energy storage investment characteristics, not every day to sell the COINS, but mainly the chariot COINS, so don't stare, every day on real-time currency, the normal life and work, Make money easy and fun. What's more, when the price of coins goes up and you have another batch of coins, you have enough chips to trade. Mining is a continuous discounted investment behavior, can obtain lower cost chips. When the currency rises to a certain price, there is no need to worry about short selling. Basically, by participating in mining, you can eat a big chunk of the entire market. It is a relatively stable investment way

**Aman Matasulu:** Thanks for this big opportunity, sharing with the group…and I'm ready…

**Host:** Let's start the AMA session,

**1st Segment: Introduction**

**Host: 1: First of all please introduce yourself, Your background and share an interesting story of how you got into crypto, and also tell about your team and founders?**

**Say “Done” when you complete your answer thanks.**

**Aman Matasulu:** Hi, my name is Aman Matasulu, and I’m the founder of KALA COIN. after more than 10 years in Branding and Design Agency, I think now it is a good start to start a digital product and we named it KALA. When I work at the agency, some of our clients are crypto brands. That how I gain my skill and interest in the crypto world. I like the challenge in the cryptocurrency project, there is an amazing digital ecosystem that builds the brand. In kala now, I’m handling the management and marketing part.

In technology, all handled by HELMI ANDITO as KALA Chief of technology. His background is 100% in IT and Technology. both of us are from the agency. and now we are ready to make KALA grow.

**Host: 2: I am excited to know more about KALA, Can you please explain the main concept behind “KALA”?**

**Aman Matasulu:** Kala is taken from Sanskrit which means ‘time’. Kala also represents the past, present, and future. And KALI as the feminine aspect of KALA has the meaning of empty or dark time itself is a definition. In Indonesia, we also have Batara Kala that has the same concept. So, the keyword is “time”

We take and apply this concept to KALA COIN, “time” is something very valuable. As we know, in cryptocurrency time is super important. Every second is valuable, and you need to make the decision every time. We want KALA to become valuable, rare, give a big impact on our community.

**Host: 3: I can see the $KALA token is live. Can you please share more details about its sales and listings? What are the utilities of your token $KALA?**

\*\*Aman Matasulu:\*\*KALA — Aman Matasulu, \[12-Oct-2021 at 20:11:26\]:

…o, our utilities/use-case is to become the main currency in our nft market, but that is in our last phase. Before that, we prepare all the ecosystems first, a lot of things we need to prepare.

And the good news is, we have KALA Wallet, Dex Kala, KALA Staking, and Kala Farming that we will be launching in the next 3 Days. All of the projects are works and become part of our ecosystems.

And we alywas do some regular maintenance and updates like the ui/ux, or add another feature. Please note : We work based on our roadmap as our timeline, and we completed the first phase in 14 days..and now on second phase.

About the listing, we already prepare and choose base on the region. But again, we only baby in this crypto world, we launch on 21 Sept 2021, about 3 weeks ago.

And FYI, we are already on NOMICS, and we already apply in Coingecko and soon on Coinmarketcaps. From the marketing part, we do daily promotions, taken from the marketing fee wallet. The big marketing will start on phase III.

**Host: KALA project was launched about 2 weeks ago and we would love to know that how many developments and new features you have completed till now?**

**Aman Matasulu:** KALA — Aman Matasulu, \[12-Oct-2021 at 20:26:08 (12-Oct-2021 at 20:27:59)\]:

Until now we have Kala Wallet, ready on Google Play, (beta version). Dex Kala, Kala Staking…and soon Kala Farming in the next few days. For Kala stacking, we have rewards such as $ADA $SHIB $BUSD $BUSD $XRP, and 2 other local tokens.

And you should try our KALA STACKING, the APY is perfect! With an amazing reward…😊😊

**Host: 5: What are the main features that distinguish you from other projects and what competitive advantages do you have?**

**Aman Matasulu:** 1. Lets start with the supply, our supply is only 100 Million Token, and already burned 39% and 15% will be burned next, for detail feel free to check our roadmap on website…/

2. Our wallet is ready on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=finance.kala.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=finance.kala.app) ) — and it works, please give it a try..

3. Our KALA SWAP is ready with a cheaper gas fee and anti-lagLink: [https://dapp.kala.finance/swap](https://dapp.kala.finance/swap)

4 We launch our staking with rewards such as $BUSD, $ADA $XRP $SHIB and some local token. And farming will be ready in the next 7 days. I think this is good news for everyone! and the reflection rewards…

so, we just launched on the 21st of October, it was just 3 weeks ago, but we completed 3 of our projects. ( KALA WALLET, KALA SWAP, KALA STACKING).

5. All developers are Doxxed, you can find our developer social media link in our website ( kala.finance ) . And almost every night we are on telegram voice and video calls.

For international, we prepare to get audited as soon as possible.

**2nd Segment: Questions from Twitter Announcement.**

**6: do you have any plan for burning tokens in the future to reduce the supply of the token and increase its investment attractiveness?**

**Question by g76974594**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes, we already burn 39%, and we will burn another 5% ( 5M token ) when we reach 5.000 Holder…

Another 5% in phase III

Another 5% in phase IV.

**7: In my opinion, a project needs to deal with solving a real-world issue or problem What is the problem that your project primarily focuses on?**

**Question by Ibrahem24254134**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes… Agree! The Emotional selling point from KALA is “This is Indonesia Token. from Indonesia-for Indonesia… we want to start with our baby step first! Focus on Indonesia market, give big impact to the community especially in culture, education, and finance.

We want everything step by step and based on the timeline, also focus on it.We give real facts, not just the dream, we want to different from our competitors…

**8: Staking is very important for every project to attract users. So does Kala Coin project have a staking program? If yes, how can we stake your token? Are there any requirement for users?**

**Question by tuan\_iker**

**Aman Matasulu:** No, you can’t stake KALA. You will rewarded KALA, only in on KALA FARMING. Don't worry, we will launch in the next 3 Days…

**3rd Segment: Community Round.**

**Is your project only for English speaking countries or do you have any community for nonenglish speaking users too?**

**Aman Matasulu:** As I said before, the goal is for the community but we start in Indonesia first, after 3 weeks in Indonesian market, we are ready to expand globally. Now the team is preparing all global groups, based on the region.. So yes, we will prepare content, group, in a few languages…but English and Indonesia as a primary language.

.

For more questions, you can join the global group..and the admin will help you..

**Marketing is very important for any project because good marketing makes the company look smart and powerful, so what is Kala marketing strategy?**

**Aman Matasulu:** Yes. Agree!! But besides marketing to promote, I still think the brand itself is one of the important things. The unique selling is the token features itself, but the emotional selling is THIS IS INDONESIAN TOKEN.

We blend all that into one marketing strategy and deliver to the world! and community as our basic media to speak to the world! KALA will never grow without the community. Now, for us, just need to find the perfect digital media to gain the exposure of KALA token based on community regions.

The marketing plan is ready until June 2022, but, we still do the research to find out more about the audience. So all the marketing strategy speaks to the right audience.

**.Most of the new investors, only focus on the price of the token and the short term benefits of the project rather than understanding the true value of the project. Can you tell us about the motivations and benefits for investors to hold your tokens long-term?**

**Aman Matasulu:** hi..I like this question.

for KALA, we are focus on Community! That's become the strongest point for us, and that's why we can kill zero in 7 days, we can deliver all projects on time…the support, the input of the community is the important one…and the price will follow, equal with the marketing strategy.

.

And Kala is a long terms project. Why? because represent our Motherland — Indonesia. From Indonesia for the world…

𝙒𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙝 𝙤𝙣𝙚 𝙤𝙛 𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙨𝙚 𝙖𝙨𝙥𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙨 𝙞𝙨 𝙞𝙢𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙮𝙤𝙪?

𝙄𝙣 𝙬𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙚𝙧?

**Aman Matasulu:** The answer is the Community TRUST.

After we gain the community's trust, the community is self will become KALA's strongest media to spread all the good news about KALA.

AND the effect will be the price token and new partners in every aspect.

**Can Kala share with us some of the future plans, such as the marketing development plan and recent activity plan for Kala?**

**Aman Matasulu:** For now, the plan is just 5000 Holder, we already apply to CG and CMC…meanwhile we approach all the listing and exchanger….

Host: Thank you so much u/amanmatasulu for the very detailed answers!

**I would recommend to our community please join KALA social media channels for more updates**

In a world where we cannot agree on anything, we now have a form of money you can personally audit to your heart's content, dive down the rabbit hole as deep as it takes for you to realize this truth for yourself and how perfectly Bitcoin fulfills it, and determine how valuable a single sat is to you. At this point enough people have studied, audited and invested in Bitcoin to bring the price from less than nothing to be now worth over 60 thousand American dollars. That is the writing on the wall, the era of fiat currency is officially over. The End. In hindsight, future generations will laugh at the ridiculousness of this era. They will wonder things like why we ever accepted the notion of investing our money to beat inflation, which sounds a lot like spending your money to save it, which is objectively stupid. How much simpler it is to just hodl your money until you're ready to spend it, and be rest assured it will be as valuable as the day you got it, or more.

With the activation of Taproot we have shown the world once again what sanity looks like. Bitcoin is the perfect money because it is money we can perfect, together, through consensus. Things here move slowly so that everyone is on board and you only have to run the code you're comfortable with, those are the rules you play by. It beats the hell out of the fiat alternative, where you make no decisions, and things constantly get worse.

I believe money is the painfully necessary path our species had to walk to reach enlightenment, that the world is best served when everyone is able to do what they do best, where people are encouraged to find jobs they love doing so much they do it for free, and if there are jobs nobody wants to do then we find a way to automate it. I believe Bitcoin is the final money because it was designed to pump forever, and will eventually reach such an astronomical value that even having a single satoshi on the time chain that you can sign for will be enough to be set for life. In a world like that, you don't even need to spend your sats anymore, because everyone is set for life, doing things they love doing and giving it away for free. It's simultaneously the most trippy-hippy fantasy I can imagine and the actual late stage of capitalism. Bitcoin is the end of duality; Bitcoin is the singularity.

To me, owning sats means you're voting for a better world. Maybe not the same one I believe we're headed towards, but better than wherever we are right now. It means that you and me agree on something, that we see enough value in a sat to hodl it over all other forms of money. And if we can agree with eachother about this one thing, this one tiny little piece of objective truth in the world, then maybe there's other things we have in common too.

AFAIK, the root cause of the 2008 crisis was that subprime mortgages were being credited and bonds based on those poor/risky mortgages were being rated as highly safe. Either due to corruption (mostly) or incompetence of the rating authorities.

IMO, crypto could not have helped fixing or flagging this root cause earlier in any way. So when the mortgage defaulting finally began, the banks went down, money stopped circulating, joblessness started like never before.

So the govt had to bail out the banks and financial institutions to restart the stuck economy. The govt NEEDS and sometimes prints the money to fund itself and/or the economy. Is that not just govt's way of saying: ""We messed up. We won't bother you with adding more taxes(which most people cannot pay by the way), we'll just make you all poorer in equal proportions so we can all stop being stuck with no way out!!""?

All in the name of being able to continue to run the nation of course.

Whenever someone is singing the crypto praises, they mention the 2008 crisis. I simply don't get how a crypto would have been able to help in a stuck economy or prevent it from getting stuck in the first place.

The more I think about it, the more I feel that crypto taking away the govt's ability to print money would have actually harmed us even more in the 2008 crisis. We would have been stuck for way longer know!?

Am I being naive in thinking that the govt REALLY had no option but to bail out the financial institutions in order to unstuck the economy?

I'm new to crypto and I am learning all about this amazing space.  I think the technology is amazing and it's great to see a community where the people are so energized to create and innovate.  I was not old enough to experience the creation of the internet, but I can imagine it to be somewhat comparable to what we are experiencing at the current moment in this space.

The recent news of the Islamic faith's designation of cryptocurrency as Haram (forbidden) has made me step back and think about the place that cryptocurrency has in society and whether or not it is good for our long-term survival as a species.  Perhaps this question is better suited for a philosophy forum, but I will ask it here anyway...

Is artificial scarcity ethical?  

The human mind has evolved to place increased value on certain things over others as an attempt to guide our action toward that which benefits our long-term genetic survival.  

It seems to me that Bitcoin is very cleverly exploiting a psychological loophole in our minds the same way that social media exploits our need for human connection and tribalism, video games exploit our need for competitive status, or pornography exploits our need for sexual expression.

The philosophical question is...

When a technology results in a change in human behavior that does not lead to increased odds of genetic survival, is that technology serving the best interest of the species?

If it is not serving the best interest of the species, then how can it be considered ethical?

Is Bitcoin helping us create a better world, or is it tricking us into feeling like we are getting a better deal than we actually are --  the same way social media, porn etc. tricks our minds into thinking we are getting a good deal.

So that first line is obviously marvelous, but after that is a block that looks a lot like ASCII art, but I think the order is messed up.

Anyone got the patience to try and scramble them into order?

This was the Rust script I used to get the OP_RETURNs:

	//! first get the block in hex using 
	//! $ bitcoin-cli getblock $(bitcoin-cli getblockhash 709632) false &gt; taproot.hex
	//!
	//! Then run this program with 
	//! $ cargo run taproot.hex
	
	use bitcoin::Block;
	use bitcoin::blockdata::script;
	use bitcoin::hashes::hex::FromHex;
	
	fn main() {
		let filename = std::env::args().skip(1).next().unwrap();
		let file = std::fs::read(filename).unwrap();
		let hex = std::str::from_utf8(&amp;file).unwrap().trim();
		let bytes = Vec::&lt;u8&gt;::from_hex(&amp;hex).unwrap();
		let block = bitcoin::consensus::deserialize::&lt;Block&gt;(&amp;bytes).unwrap();
	
		block.txdata.iter().skip(1) // skip coinbase
			.map(|tx| tx.output.iter()).flatten() // all outputs
			.map(|output| &amp;output.script_pubkey) // all scripts
			.filter(|s| s.is_op_return()) // the op_return scripts

Even to family and friends. Even then I am less than truthful. I only have one friend who knows I own any. If he asks how it's doing I'll only talk about the last dip. I'll just say ""there was a dip last week and I lost 2 grand."" 

Well my buddy may know Im hiding something. He is fairly wealthy and he told me he had 20 thousand he was looking to invest and wanted to know how much he should put into bitcoin. I told him to put in the maximum amount he would be willing to loose. This shocked him. He said ""I don't want to loose anything."" I told him that its not that your going to loose it its that you have to be willing to loose it. I said if you're not willing to loose it you will panic at the first big dip and sell. Then you will actually loose money. If you are willing to loose it when it dips you won't care and you can ride it out until you see a profit. He just said ""yeah thats not for me."" I think this was good advice but he ain't gonna buy in. 

I bought my first literaly minutes before a huge dip and a bear market. At that point I was so new I didn't have faith in the tech. I actually thought I bought in right before the death of bitcoin. I now realize how stupid I was then. I figured oh well if I loose it I loose it, lets ride this out and see what happens. I wish I had bought more back then, but I also know that if I had bought more I would have sold it at that dip just to minimize a huge loss.

Not sure how to approach the friends asking for advice thing. Its a funny market and its not for everyone.

I know like many of you I am skeptical and when things don’t seem to smell right I ask myself “Who benefits?” and in this case it’s clearly not the consumer. The SEC is charged with protecting retail investors which would make the most plausible kind of ETF to be approved a spot ETF however, the futures ETF was the one that was approved and there are now multiple. The thing about futures ETFs is they don’t end up affecting the underlying assets price much and don’t track the price of bitcoin very closely which causes a disconnect. One can’t help, but realize that by doing this the powers that be are trying to keep the status quo by attempting to put the genie back in the bottle and disrupt bitcoins price discovery. 

WHY THIS MATTERS

Bitcoin is arguably the gateway drug to crypto. I for one got into crypto in 2017 because I heard about bitcoin hitting 10k, but went into altcoins. The bottom line is bitcoin is the poster child for the crypto space and the better it does (at least for now) the more people and institutions come into the space, which is something that is good for all of us for many reasons. I won’t pretend to really understand what's going on at the technical level with spot and futures ETFs. I’m just some millennial PE teacher who in my free time hops around discord servers, lurks on various subreddits and listens to a lot of crypto podcasts. Both Mark Yusko and Plan B who obviously are legends have hinted themselves that there could be foul play here with the SECs decision to embrace futures ETFs. I was inspired by /r WallStreetBets a year ago and it feels like this moment could be the spiritual successor of last year's ape fest. Let's break the glass ceiling, the lid they tried to put on bitcoin. Bitcoin is and represents money for the people, the ability to redistribute wealth, and create a more equitable and censorship resistant future. I am lucky to live in the U.S, a country with its own problems as every other country has theirs. However, one thing I think we can all agree on is that the world isn’t perfect, infact far from it, but there is a step we can take to make it much better for us all.

I also just realized that UK users can't download bitcoin core.  Apparently it originates from a ruling in the UK asserting that Fakatoshi, according to that judge, is in fact Nakamoto.

Although the ruling only covers the whitepaper, full node software will download the entire block data.  And since the whitepaper is embedded in one of the blocks, full node software is also included in the order.  So full software needs Fakatoshi's permission to run.  As a result, full node software such as bitcoin core difficult to distribute in the UK without running into legal crossfire.

Into stocks of companies that have no real growth. They just use easy government money to finance debt and buyback shares and create synthetic growth and these market bubbles.

Just a strong interest in both quantum computing and cryptography. I've also simplified a lot of concepts, because they are complex and don't fundamentally bring anything more to the discussion

**Introduction**
With IBM announcing their new quantum chip with 127 qubits, I thought i'd clear any misunderstandings concerning quantum computing as a threat to cryptocurrencies and cryptography as a whole. For this, we need to do a quick physics and cryptography recap.

**The physics**
Qubits form the fundamental unit of quantum information, just like the bit is the fundamental unit of information in classical computing. Classicaly, the bit may take 2 values, either a 1 or a 0. In a quantum system, the qubit may be in a coherant superposition of both states. If this seems counterintuitive to you, I highly recommend the computerphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv-YXKRUheQ) on superposition, which will give you a much more intuitive notion of superposition. Quantum computing has an edge over classical computing via the implementation of quantum algorithms, which perform better than classical algorithms for a certain class of problems

**The cryptography**
Cryptographic functions are used in different ways in the bitcoin protocol. I won't get into too much detail as it is beyond the scope of this piece, but will go over two main functions.

1st - The public-private key pair. When you generate your seed phrase, you're creating a public-private key pair. These are interesting because both can be used to encrypt or decrypt a message, and consequently, to prove ownership of something. For example:

* Alice has both a public and private key
* Alice encrypts her message using the private key
* Alice shares her public key to the world
* Bob takes Alice's public key to decrypt Alice's message
* Bob therefore knows Alice is the one who wrote the message

We can see how this can be used in the bitcoin protocol. Simply put, each UTXO belongs to an address (which is derived from your public key, more on that later) and can only be spent by the holder of the corresponding private key (by signing the transaction).

2nd - The hash function. Hash functions are used for the proof of work part, where to mint a block, a hash of pending transactions and a nonce is generated (this is a gross simplification). The first person to generate a hash with a leading number of 0's may add his block to the blockchain and gather the rewards. Difficulty is adjusted by adding or removing the amount of leading 0's, and is a function of the total hash power of the network. Hash functions are also used to derive your wallet address by taking the SHA256 hash of the public key, and then taking the RIPEMD-160 hash of the previously SHA256 hashed output. A hash of a hash.

**The Threat ?**
SHA256 is a time-tested hashing algorithm, which is widely thought to be secure and quantum resistant. Therefore, both mining and freshly generated wallets are immune to any attack, quantum or not. The issue comes when spending UTXO's. When you spend your bitcoin, you are broadcasting your public key to the network. In a classical world, this wouldn't be an issue, as computing the private key from a public key is an NP problem, i.e it is computationally too expensive to solve with a classical computer. This is where Shor's algorithm comes along. In 1994, Peter Shor showed that prime factorization can be performed in polynomial time using a quantum computer. In other words, with sufficient logical qubits, one could derive the private key from a public key. Even though ECDSA, the digital signature algorithm which is used in the bitcoin protocol, uses elliptical curves, both class of problems have similar properties which makes elliptical curve cryptography vulnerable to Shor's algorithm.

Now for the reality check

IBM's computer is comprised of 127 PHYSICAL qubits, which are subject to decoherance. Simply put, these qubits don't behave like the idealised LOGICAL qubits. It is my understanding that a true implementation of Shor's algorithm was not able to factor out the number 35 see [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59795/largest-integer-factored-by-shors-algorithm) and [here](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012305). You can access the paper using scihub to find the quote in the article ""Eventually, the algorithm fails to factor N = 35. This is due to the cumulative errors coming from the increasing number of two-qubit gates necessary to implement the more complex MEF needed for this case"".

Furthermore, modern software wallets can generate a prohibitively large amount of private keys from a single seed phrase. This means that if Alice has 1 Bitcoin and sends Bob 0.1 Bitcoin, the remaining 0.9 are moved along as well to another address, in a manner which is completely transparent to Alice. With an average time of 10 minutes between minted blocks, this would leave very little time for an attacker to steal funderus (provided the transaction i included in the next block). It should be noted that in 2018, there were approximately 30 % of bitcoins with ""public"" public keys [source](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/computing/public/1718-ug-projects/Dragos-Ilie-Making-Bitcoin-Quantum-Resistant-(Iain-Steward-and-the-Centre-for-Cryptcurrency-Research-and-Engineering).pdf)

Does this mean Bitcoin is safe for ever ??

Definitely not. Although according to most predictions we are still year if not decades away from breaking ECDSA, measures should be taken to implement quantum resistant digital signatures. One can hope that it will be implemented in the coming years through a BIP. I hope I've clear up any misunderstanding with bitcoin and quantum computing, and hopefully quantum resistant digital signatures will be implemented in the coming years",3562004,On bitcoin and the quantum threat,0,1.0,2021-11-15 22:08:22,NEGATIVE,0.7267327904701233

I've been in a few FIRE (Financial Independence and Retire Early) subreddits and every time someone mentions crypto the post gets downvoted to hell and the comments complain about the person being dumb without people even understanding crypto.

Some very helpful person has created a subreddit for cryptocurrency and financial independence to be a place for likeminded individuals who can have proper conversations about crypto and FIRE in general without being downvoted and trolled.

If you are interested, please join!

It is a very new community so it'd be great to get as many posts up as we can and spread the word!",3561673,There is now a Cryptocurrency focused FIRE subreddit!,0,1.0,2021-11-15 20:33:27,NEGATIVE,0.8883056640625

Hello all so recently I transferred most of my BTC and ETH from Gemini (online exchange/wallet) to Exodus and Atomic (desktop wallets). I did this because I thought ""what if Gemini happens to pull a mt. Gox or get hacked or locks my funds for some reason?"" I know it's super unlikely, but the whole ""not your keys, not your coins"" phrase seems to be pretty common sense to keep them in a desktop wallet with your own keys.

But then, how reliable are exodus and atomic wallets? To be more specific:

Is it possible that the developers of either of these wallets could leave something in the code for them to see people's keys? Or to simply transfer money out of people's wallets? If it's not possible, how do you know it's not possible? As far as I know both are not completely open source.

In addition, what would happen if the developers simply decided to leave the project and never update it again, would the wallet continue to be functional?

Is there any wallet that is not associated with a company and is simply a basic code/software that doesn't need updating? Like, what was the first bitcoin wallet and is that still functional?

The reality is that bitcoin is a distributed global monetary protocol that is controlled by no one. It’s a global, permissionless and immutable system to store and transact value and is open to all - something that has never existed in human history and that provides immense utility. [These objective realities](https://youtu.be/ZKwqNgG-Sv4) are largely where bitcoin derives its substantial and increasing value. These are also the technical reasons why the bitcoin network is the fastest growing technology of all time and is the best performing asset class of all time too. It’s not a bubble and it’s not an accident - it’s a new technology finding it’s market value over time. And this is all driven from voluntary participation by ~200,000,000 global participants, with that number increasing every day. 

The fact that an unbiased and decentralized 24/7 global monetary network exists, open to all, should be heartening. The massive systemic risk present in the incumbent corrupt and centralized debt-based systems is what’s worrying. Having a parallel yet superior system that’s fair and stable to opt into shouldn’t be taken for granted. 

Millions of people on this planet who weren’t born into privileged and advanced economies have already found bitcoin out of necessity. So many have been tangibly helped by the network when there was literally no other option for them. It’s saved countless lives. 

I encourage you to continue learning about bitcoin specifically and the millions of people in Venezuela, [Sudan, Nigeria](https://youtu.be/DDir1mclIRw), [El Salvador](https://youtu.be/yL6J56Jzvl0), Brazil, Argentina, India, Russia, Zimbabwe, the Philippines, Libya, [Palestine](https://youtu.be/HOPphO-ktNc) (and effectively every other country in some capacity) who have been helped by having access to the pinnacle of financial services when nothing else existed for them. The countries I mentioned specifically have all been ravaged by economic hardships like hyperinflation and political / economic corruption. Bitcoin is hope for them as much as it is for you and me - we’re just lucky we don’t *need* bitcoin, yet. But you’d be smart to plan for the day we will need it. Incumbent systems in the “west” are rotten and corrupt as well. Just papered together in a better way. 

Bitcoin isn’t about timing the market. It’s about having a fair and immutable alternative system anyone can opt into. Despite the misunderstandings, this is reality. The reason bitcoin has continued to grow at the fastest rate of any new technology ever created is because *it is* what it claims to be.

I started mining BTC in 2015 in China, and have since moved my operations to the US. Currently my company is building a new renewable energy totally immersion cooling [center in Texas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pccqf6/liquid_cooled_my_latest_mining_center_opening_for/). Through the years, I've developed relations with Bitmain to the point where I exclusively mine with their hardware.

I receive a lot of DMs on Reddit or elsewhere asking, ""can I buy one please"". The problem for the average joe retail miner is that they don't have access to the direct channels with the manufacturers at wholesale prices. Especially if you only want to ""buy one please"".

But more than that, one of the best parts about the hardware business is buying/selling the futures contracts. The closer to delivery date, the more expensive they get. As some of you probably know, we can buy a contract for 100 miners from Bitmain delivery in July, and then sell the contract to someone else, before we even take delivery, for a profit.

**These are the two main issues that I think a ASIC Miner NFT would solve.**

1. **Ability for retail investors to get only a couple of units at wholesale.**
2. **Ease to buy/sell the future contracts in the form of an NFT.**

This is basically a crowdsourced ASIC mining hardware PTA (physical tangible asset) NFT. I will use my relationship with Bitmain to get wholesale prices. In stock machines in the US are selling from $120-150 per TH/s on Amazon and Ebay. If the current trend continues, we can expect landed S19 XP 150TH/s to sell for around $18-$20,000.

Once the hardware is delivered in the US, (to my warehouse), holders will need to burn their NFT in order for their unit to be shipped to them. However, you could sell the NFT before delivery.

Historically speaking, the futures contracts of the mining hardware have risen in price the closer it is to the delivery date. We are tokenizing these futures contracts enabling the ability to buy and sell before delivery. Payback on these models is currently 6-7 months estimated by NiceHash.

I've gone ahead and made a couple OS listings, although sale hasn't started. This is just me with an idea and to see if its good or not.

And please, all feedback is very welcome. I will be transparent as possible, posting my contracts, PO's, and possibly conversations with Bitmain on my website for the project - if/when we decide to launch.",3539320,Need Opinions on a S19XP NFT,0,1.0,2021-11-11 06:22:25,NEGATIVE,0.873197615146637

*it’s so old, why is it so slow??, who would spend so much for one transaction?, it uses too much energy, it’s bad for the environment!!*

And then people started saying that bitcoin isn’t like a currency anymore it’s more like **gold**. *That seems like a lame excuse to keep your coin from dying…*


**And today it hit me**, this thing it’s the first of it’s kind. Its already being written into history books. From the white paper to the founder everything about it is unique. This thing it’s so special and has these special properties, it will hold decades into the future. And this uniqueness will develop into something priceless.

**I saw the future.**

Just imagine with me, in the year 2140 when the last bitcoin will be mined, even a 6 year old will know, if you hold a bitcoin you’re part of history.

Lets skip ahead, its the year 2210. You’re an 18 year old, your father wants to show you something. Your family heirloom. It’s 1000 whole satoshi. You cry tears of joy and play with the thought that maybe one day your great-great-grandsons can be part of the highly advanced society on mars, where only those who prove ownership of one bitcoin can enter.

Lets go even further into the future. The year is 2540. A starship the size of the moon has it’s eyes on Kepler-282c. A planet which holds the most diverse items on ancient computer history. The most secured item is an hardware wallet that holds 1 bitcoin. The starship threatens with total annihilation if the wallet and password isn’t handed over. Shortly after an interplanetary war breaks out in which billions and billions of humanoids die.

TL/DR: Bitcoin is already part of history and will only become more and more unique and scarce

The S&amp;P 500 is up 32% and Bitcoin is up 275% from last year.

When debating people who are still speculative about bitcoin, I am not sure what to say when they bring up investing in the S&amp;P 500 because it has been +18% yield against inflation and it is considered a safe investment for them vs Bitcoin.

Now I was listening to a Saylor video and he was saying how the reason the S&amp;P 500 has gone up so much is because of all money that has been printed in the last couple years and it gets funnelled into these top 500 companies or something of that nature. 

If you have a better explanation why the S&amp;P 500 had gone up so much please let me know.

I have a few Questions:

1. Am I able to buy and sell Bitcoin as often as I want? (Is once or twice a week okay for example?)

2. How will I be taxed on these buy and sells and are there other fees? (Was planning on buying at 62,000 for example and selling at like 68,000. I would repeat this and make money since that is almost 10 percent profit each time if I was able to do that perfectly BUT am I taxed on how much I take out OR the profit on what I take out? Also any other fees? 

To be more clear IF

So if I put in 62000 and sell at 68000 ten times I would double my money and have $60,000 profit. Would I be taxed on the profit taken out OR how much I take out because $68,000 taken out ten times is $680,000 and I don't know the tax number but if it is 25 percent then I lose money. And is this the same for normal stocks?)


Bonus Question: What are the tax percentages?

Also I know it's unlikely to stay at the $60,000 to $70,000 phase but I see a lot of potential earnings but nobody talks about it so what is the issue? Taxes or fees or risk or what?

Hello fellow bitcoiners!

I first discovered this video a number of months ago, and I've watched it twice more since then. I think Ray Dalio is correct with his analysis, and I think you'd be hard pressed trying to convince anyone who understands economics otherwise. 

Now here's my real question to you all here; assuming Dalio is correct about how this works in a fiat world, how does bitcoin fit into it/change it? 

You may immediately think that there wouldn't be cycles anymore with bitcoin, but I don't believe that is true. There will still be cycles because people will still borrow money, with the main difference being that interest rates will be generally higher all the time. So, at the very least, there will be short term cycles. 

What I'm struggling with is the long term cycle. Is it possible that bitcoin eliminates the long term cycle?

He has an online plateforme where people can invest money. They also have a referral program.
Instead of just running away with the money of the people, he uses it to give it back to previous investors, so here's the Ponzi side of things.
Since the people are very clueless, he is manipulation the prices and probably using altcoins, as he says he is ""manipulating the prices"".

So people will see a chart and believe what's on the website. But if you compare the chart with a untampered chart, you can see BTC wasn't at the same price that day.

In the end, people think they made some small gains (or lost things), and most don't notice it's a scam because they are dumb enough to use that kind of website after being attracted by a man with a rented car and costume and do not have time to check BTC/Altcoins prices.

I'm still studying this case and not sure of what the URL is. If it is the one I am thinking about it already has some bad reviews so I'm not doing harm.

But, if, like me, you were wondering why there are people who really ""made money"" from scammy type of sites, this is how it works.
He has a few people that he keeps giving money to so they convince/show people it's legit.

While completely illegal, I thought it was pretty smart to combine Ponzi with price manipulation, referral, and make a decent looking website.

So, be careful people, high percentage of win being promised almost always equals scam, even if you get an initial win!",3613332,Another type of scam involving price manipulation and ponzi.,0,1.0,2021-11-29 12:01:22,NEGATIVE,0.998492956161499

I'm come from the Netherlands and have a few questions about a Ledger Nano X/S:  


1. \-Why don't you need to install the whole blockchain when using a Ledger?
2. \-Can I still use the Ledger and the app when the blockchain size is much bigger in a few years?
3. \-Can I only use the Ledger in combination with the Ledger app? **What if** the Ledger app doesn't exist in 5 years anymore and the company is gone. Can I do a transaction without using the Ledger software on my PC?
4. \-**What if** my ledger is broken and the company doesn't exist anymore, so I can't buy a new ledger?

The continuously dwindling rate of bitcoin ( which is the mother of all cryptocurrencies) has been so unstable and continually affecting other cryptocurrencies. I have tried a lot of ways to make me and my followers gain during this period but it has been super tough.  


In my quest to find an answer, i came across a platform; multicoinbank.  
com, at first, i was super certain it was one of the usual scams but i did more research and noticed i could not find any valid negative claim against this platform, so i decided to try it out. They accept four(4) different types of cryptocurrency; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.  


I decided, to try out the least amount to invest in, i invested both Bitcoin and Ethereum using different accounts, in case they were one of those ponzi schemes that uses funds from one account to pay the other till they could no longer do so. To my surprise, i got my promised returns in 10 days after investing ( i still believed this was a one off). I continued investing three more times before increasing my invested amount and i keep opening different accounts to be sure its not ponzi an to my utmost surprise, till date, i still receive my returns.  


So, my two cents is, if you want a seem-less way to invest your funds, you can try out the cryptohodlerfx Investment Group but be careful, try it out first with little capital and always make sure you are gaining more than you are investing, it is not rocket science or a get quick program but be careful still.

What a bore. Have you ever wondered, however, why the comparison is to countries? Why don’t they ever tell you what would seem to be a more natural comparison which is how much “Bitcoin” spends on electricity?


The reason is that electricity is incredibly cheap so Bitcoin electricity expenditures priced in dollars don’t look very large. Bitcoin uses something like 100 terawatt hours (TWH) of electricity annually (depending on the price of Bitcoin) but a TWH costs less than $100 million (10 cents per KWH times 1000000000). Thus, Bitcoin spends say $10 billion on electricity annually. (In fact, it’s less than this since bitcoin miners can be located in places where electricity prices are especially cheap.)

$10 billion in spending isn’t a lot. It’s less than the world spends on toothpaste ($30b), much less than the US spends on cigarettes ($80b), and considerably less than the US Federal government spends in one day ($18.65 billion).

 
If we think of the $10 billion spent by Bitcoin as a security budget (as the spending secures the blockchain) it also compares reasonably to US bank spending on cybersecurity. Bank of America alone spent more than $1 billion on its cybersecurity budget and the total financial security budget is much larger.

So the next time you read that Bitcoin consumes as much electricity as Sweden substitute Bitcoin spends as much on electricity as Americans spend on Halloween costumes.

Sort of.

He has a moderate degree of technical literacy - he runs Linux on his desktop computer, but with a Windows XP VM inside it, just as a point of comparison.

I was thinking about making him what amounts to a paper wallet with my ColdCard, and then doing something like etching the details and the pair of QR codes into one or two pieces of aluminum bar stock - something that he can hold and that's tangible - and maybe pre-loading a little bit into this wallet, and helping him import the wallet into the Electrum app.  We have semi-regular reasons to transfer money (usually me to him), so I could easily use that wallet to send money to him, and it could start to develop a bit of a balance over time.

But then I got to thinking: he's going to ask me, ""what can I do with money once it's in there?"" He's never been interested in investing in things he can't physically possess. And so I started thinking of all the things *I* could imagine using the BTC in a wallet for - buying a VPN subscription, or other online services, etc. You could buy gift cards from Gyft, which he isn't really into.  I heard you could buy things at Home Depot's website, and went there to try to do that, but couldn't locate it - seems like they took that down. I know you might be able to strike a deal for BTC on Craigslist, but that seems like slim pickens in our area.  You could turn the BTC into USD in a bank, but then you have to have to go to an exchange and give them all the KYC details that I know he would never divulge, and you eliminate the whole non-banked aspect. (For example, he can't use PayPal anymore because they started requiring a SSN, etc.)

So, unfortunately, I'm kind of at a loss as to what value this digital currency is to someone who doesn't already spend money on online services, and who would rather own reloading components or diesel for the tractor or seed potatoes than an intangible asset that *might* (almost certainly will, but from his perspective, might) appreciate.

* In the beginning of commerce, people were limited to either barter or measure precious metals to estimate worth. This was extremely slow and limited economic expansion.  

* Money &amp; Currency need to coexist. Money is hard assets of stored value, currency is often pegged to money, but it needs to be less volatile. When governments got involved throughout history they have created a currency (typically backed by money) to standardize exchange.  

* Though the Federal Reserve is bullshit, they do 1 thing I appreciate which is to try to stabilize the currency to make the economic transactions less volatile.

&amp;#x200B;

In the event that all fiat currencies die and let's say only Bitcoin exists, that means that the whole world value would be measured against Bitcoin. As the world continues to innovate and produce more at say X rate, that means that the purchasing power of Bitcoin would continue to grow at X rate. Merchants would be constantly lowering the prices by X - this is problematic. Not that Bitcoin and the free market couldn't technically function, I just think it would slow economic expansion down.

So I had been thinking, how do we create a currency that is universal to the world that can be exchanged so that Bitcoin can be the money that it is pegged to? My thought went further to the concept of a heavily automated world where less and less human labor is needed.

My answer: **Wattage**. If Bitcoin was $10,000,000 a coin, the mining industry would explode as it would be so profitable to mine. As the mining industry grows to match such a high value, eventually the network would become so difficult that it would level off again around the price of electricity. Same thing would happen in reverse, a $1,000 coin would shut most of the mining rigs down until things stabilize once more.

Wattage is the same in every country, and is universally used. It has an unlimited supply allowing it to expand with the rate of economic expansion, and the mining industry as previously written essentially does the 1 good thing from the Federal Reserve automatically.

In conclusion, I think the human race needs to adopt Wattage as our exchange unit of currency; and Bitcoin would be the medium in which it is exchanged. If my theory here is remotely accurate, the day any country begins to sell Bitcoin for any form of energy (could be Oil) I think we will see the incredible parabolic rise of crypto. My estimate is that this can only take place once BTC surpasses Gold's Market Cap as it will need to have the liquidity to support massive exchanges.  


TLDR: ""Bitcoin is worth Bitcoin"" will have limitations to economic expansion. Bitcoin is the king of money, but we will need to have a universal value to always measure Bitcoin against. I believe that Wattage is the best currency to do so. I believe that we will exchange and pay for things in Bitcoin, but the prices should be in Watts.",3617519,Currency &amp; Money,0,1.0,2021-11-30 16:16:13,POSITIVE,0.9742791652679443

I wanted to share with this sub some information regarding how you may be able to raise your taxable base in some of your bitcoin holdings. This dawned on me a week ago when I saw a comment on a post discussing the difference between short term and long term capital gains tax rates, and after discussing with my tax accountant, I wanted to share with the sub for broader knowledge sharing. 

***Disclaimer: Please contact your tax preparer/accountant before you proceed with anything in real life. Make sure you understand the capital gains rules for yourself and confirm with your tax preparer/accountant.*** 

Some here may know and understand that when you sell your bitcoin it creates a taxable transaction. As the US Government recognizes bitcoin (and other cryptos) as a security, and not a currency, you need to pay taxes on the difference between what you paid for your BTC and what you sold your BTC – if it has gone up in value. These taxes are referred to as “Capital Gains” taxes – similar to gains on the sale of stocks or other assets. There are two types of capital gain taxes depending upon how long you have held the underlying asset (i.e., bitcoin) – these include Short Term and Long Term. If you have held the bitcoin for less than one year (365 days) then you will pay Short Term Capital Gains taxes – which are taxed at your marginal rate (like additional normal income). If you held your bitcoin for greater than 1 year, then you will pay Long Term Capital Gains taxes – which are taxed at varying levels depending upon your level of income.

**How to use Capital Gains to your advantage**

You will notice that for Long-Term Capital Gains there is a 0% tax rate – meaning that you will pay **ZERO** income tax on any gains on the sale of your bitcoin/assets as long as you are under the taxable income thresholds noted above (and in the link provided). As long as you have held your bitcoin for more than 1 year – you could sell your position, buy it back immediately afterward and you’d pay no income tax on the sale, but you would have increased your taxable base in your BTC – meaning that in the future you would pay less income tax on the sale of your bitcoin. 

**Other important items to note**

\- Taxable Income – you need to understand taxable income vs. your salary/total hourly wages. The difference between these two includes: (a) medical insurance premiums, (b) 401(k)/403(b) retirement contributions, (c) Health Savings Accounts (H.S.A.) contributions, (d) your standard or itemized deduction, (e) etc. 

\- You will only be able to avoid long term capital gains taxes on the amount of bitcoin sold valued between your taxable income and your respective income threshold. (see example below)

\- The standard deduction for 2021 is $12,550 for Single/Married Filing Separately, $19,400 for Head of Household, and $25,900 for Married Filing Jointly. (source: [*https://www.investopedia.com/irs-announces-tax-brackets-and-other-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022-5209190*](https://www.investopedia.com/irs-announces-tax-brackets-and-other-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022-5209190))

\- If you are able to itemize your deductions, then even more power to you because you’ll be able to drop your taxable income levels even lower than those who use the standard deduction – but MOST people qualifying for the income levels above will not be able to itemize – it would be a unicorn of a situation most likely.

 **Illustrative Example**

Jim is married to Millie. They both have jobs. Jim makes $50,000 and Millie makes $15,000. Jim pays for medical insurance and contributes to his 401(k), where Millie does not. Their paystubs (not including federal/state income taxes or FICA) total to the following:

&amp;#x200B;

|| **Jim** | **Millie** |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Salary |$50,000 | $15,000 |
| Medical Insurance Premiums |($2,000) | $0 |
| 401(k) Contributions|($4,000)| $0 |
| Taxable Income |$44,000 ***(A)***| $15,000 ***(B)*** |
||||
|Projected Total Income|$59,000 ***(A+B)*** ||
|Less: Standard Deduction|($24,000) ||
|Projected Taxable Income on Tax Return|$35,000 ***(C)***||
||||
|LT Capital Gains Threshold |$80,800 ***(D)*** ||
|Potential Income For 0% Capital Gains|$45,800 ***(C-D***||

  

Let’s assume that Jim and Millie were early adopters to Bitcoin and they purchased 3 bitcoins back in July 2015 at $300/coin (total tax basis of $900 - $300 x 3 coins). Today, those 3 bitcoins are worth $174,000 ($58,000 spot x 3 coins). Based on their current income levels (noted in the table above), Jim/Millie could sell 0.789 bitcoin for a profit of $45,800 and pay 0% taxes on it. If they were to sell, and then instantly rebuy their bitcoin, they could eliminate $45,800 of income that they’d ever have to pay taxes on in the future, as the taxable base on that .789 bitcoin would now be $45,800, rather than $300.

This also raises their taxable base for their entire bitcoin holdings from $900 ($300 x 3 BTC) to $46,425 ($300 x 2.211 BTC + $58,000 x 0.789 BTC). It raises the average taxable base for each of their 3 BTC to $15,475 ($26,425/3) from their original $300 purchase price. 

The end result of all of this was that they kept the same amount of BTC, but were able to increase their taxable base without ever having to pay any income tax on the sale – and allows them to pay less income tax on any eventual sale they decide to do. The benefit also works in the favor for if the price of BTC falls dramatically in the future as it will allow for a capital loss opportunity since you have a higher tax base. An example for that is below:

\- Jim/Mollie bought 3 BTC at $300/each. 

\- Jim/Mollie sell 0.789 BTC at $58,000 (taxable basis $45,800) and then rebuy immediately, raising their overall tax basis from $900 to $46,425 for their entire BTC portfolio (for which they pay no income tax). 

\- BTC then falls to $15,000 366 days after their purchase (must be over 1 year) 

\- Jim/Mollie can sell their 0.789 BTC and recognize a $30,375 capital loss, which can be recognized $3,000 at a time in each subsequent income tax filing until the full loss is realized – which reduces your ordinary income (i.e., salary/wages) and reduces your taxes – that’s 10+ years of reduced income tax in this example. 

\- Jim/Mollie would have to wait 31 days to repurchase their 0.789 BTC to avoid any Wash-Sale rule impacts (i.e., essentially you can’t sell to recognize a loss and immediately repurchase it – you must allow for 30 days to provide a buffer for tax purposes, otherwise people would be selling and repurchasing their assets immediately to avoid paying taxes). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

You should take a good look at the capital gains rules, contact your tax preparer/accountant (which I have and he has agreed with my understanding of the rules), and assess if your income levels allow you the opportunity to take advantage of the 0% capital gains tax rate.

**About the ad fund**

In 2010-2011, the previous top mod of /r/Bitcoin collected BTC donations with a vague idea that this BTC would be used to promote /r/Bitcoin and/or Bitcoin itself using AdSense ads or something like that. About 22.5 BTC was collected, at the time worth less than $300. When he resigned and made me top mod, he also gave me the MyBitcoin account containing the ad fund. (I luckily moved the BTC out of MyBitcoin right away... a few weeks later they ran away with everyone's BTC.)

In the past, some of the other mods used parts of the ad fund to promote /r/Bitcoin by sponsoring some eSports tournaments and by buying some Reddit ads. But I was personally never very interested in the whole ad fund idea, and there haven't been many other people interested in spearheading ad-fund projects, so the remaining ~12 BTC has been sitting around collecting dust for the past several years. I decided this year to finally empty the ad fund, and this donation sponsorship/matching event seemed like a good way to use the BTC for something worthwhile while also maintaining the spirit of the ad fund.",3617201,"/r/Bitcoin will be matching ~12BTC of your BTC donations.

I'm a longterm bitcoin hodler who as a maxi, doesn't believe we're in a technological revolution, so much as a political one. This is a belief that has carried bitcoin into this decade from 2009 and kept it alive, which a simple ""investment"" couldn't have. And as such, adoption to me is the most important goal, not Lambo's, not price, etc. We're trying to replace the money. To take away their control of the money. Demonetize the political class.

I give Opendimes as gifts often. After gifting them, I don't say anything about how they work, and let the person figure them out. This has proven to be an extraordinary tool that sets in motion for most a journey to learn more about bitcoin. 

The entropy to generate the key, physical breaking of the small chip, and requirement to set up a wallet will never be forgotten by virgins of this revolution. Don't worry about them figuring things out. It'll be ok, trust me, out of a hundred or so I've gifted, there's yet to be any issue.

Now if we want to come up with a specific answer, the only way to get it is to guess all the possibilities. Now if we replace some of the input bits that we are allowed to change according to the specific output and we replace them with variables so that in the n bits that we are allowed to change, we put the variables m\_1, m\_2,…, m\_n. so our input becomes zeroes and Ones and some variables.

SHA256 is based on several main functions, One of the most basic functions in this algorithm is XOR, which, as you can see in Table 1, has two inputs in three categories.

This function is defined as having a discrete domain that accepts only zeros and ones. Now if we replace this function with a continuous and derivative function such as function (1), not only will this function give the same answer at zeros and ones, but it will change our input range from binary to the interval \[0,1\]. Also, this function is continuous at all points and is derivative, which will help us to solve the resulting equation in the last step.

Another function used in this algorithm is the MAJ function, which calculates the common value and has three inputs in four categories.

This function, like XOR, has a discrete range of zero and one. If we replace this function with function (2), in addition to the above points, the function in the range of zero to one is also defined and is continuous and derivative.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k4h94cd2mw181.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7410d16b97f3aab8ffd0a261e406b85ddb93fe60

The Choice function is the same as the previous functions and can be replaced with function (3).

Function (3) also has the positive properties of the previously proposed functions.

The last and most important function in this algorithm is the sum function and its importance is because, unlike the previous functions, in addition to its two inputs, the overflow of its right bits must also receive and process them as input, since due to the use of variables as input Its value is unknown, it is more difficult to replace this function than other functions.

If we start the calculation of the input array from the right and consider the overflow value of the bits on the right as r, for each bit the sum of two bits with values ​​a and b follows the following function.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xjzwmm66mw181.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fb5a107068580cd1aa358dcd9d3ea8a704c411f

Initially, for the first bit on the right, the overflow value r is zero, and then its value for each bit is taken from the previous bit. The value of r calculated from the last bit is useless and is lost.

Large and small sigma functions do not need to be changed and are calculated by the alternative XOR function after the bits are moved.

By defining the above functions, the continuation of the process is like the main algorithm and the only difference is in using the above functions instead of the main functions. By performing this process and calculating (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) for each bit, a function is obtained in terms of variables m\_1, m\_2,…, m\_n.

If we consider a particular answer and convert it to a binary and equate it to the corresponding equation, a set of nonlinear equations with n variables is obtained. To solve this, you can use numerical calculation methods, which I tested for a limited number of variables and the desired result was obtained, but for a larger number of variables, I need to use advanced numerical calculation algorithms, which was beyond my ability and I couldn't do it alone.",3602263,Is it possible to use this algorithm for mining?,0,1.0,2021-11-26 09:01:59,POSITIVE,0.8267583250999451

The problem is not the fact you owe money as most people are willing to pay what they owe (most people) just so they can sleep better at night. However the problem with CGT in crypto is that it's near impossible to track and report and calculate meaning even when you are trying to do the right thing you are likely to still be on the wrong side of the law. From forks to defi to staking to gas fees to farming yield to DAOs to streaming money etc etc its impossible to calculate record and report CGT events on every single action and transaction made within the crypto space. Crypto is an asset class where you can unknowingly have 20 CGT events in a single day that all require record keeping and reporting on your taxes.

In other words CGT within crypto makes otherwise hard working innocent law abiding citizens tax frauds by default.

The only answer is to set up your life so you do not owe CGT. If you are from or live in a country that has CGT on crypto then MOVE to a country where there is no CGT on crypto, this way there is nothing to report and therefore you can't accidently end up on the wrong side of the law. 

This is exactly the reason so many bitcoiners are moving to Dubai / Singapore / Portugal / Cayman Islands etc, it's not because they are trying to save 22% its because they want to be able to use and experiment with all this new and exciting technology without having the tax office knocking on their door for not reporting some pancake swap that resulted in some staking yield from a DAO they overlooked.

CGT suffocates this space by making record keeping and reporting next to impossible to comply with, so MOVE to a country that does not tax crypto so you can breathe and not have to worry about the tax office imprisoning you just for experimenting with new technologies. Not only will your life be so much better but you will be living in a country where crypto will flourish. No companies are going to set up in countries with tax laws that make operating requirements impossible to comply with, they are all going to set up in Dubai and Singapore.

Imposing CGT on crypto is the equivalent of imposing taxes and reporting requirements on visiting websites and sending emails back in 1995.

Crypto is flourishing in countries that do not impose CGT, move their now not just to simplify your own life but to enjoy living in a city where crypto businesses will flourish making life in those cities heaven for crypto users.",3601972,Cryptocurrency capital gains is unrealistic and countries that impose it are slowly destroying their own economies.,0,1.0,2021-11-26 06:47:43,NEGATIVE,0.9993270635604858

As I understand India is set to ban many private cryptocurrencies during their parliament’s winter session, beginning deliberations of their new bill on Monday the 29th as I understand, but they might allow some coins in order to protect innovation and other values of interest given they want to de develop their own government cryptocurrency.

Could the fall tonight of more approximately $1600 at the time of this message from $59400 after such a nice climb, be related to Monday’s introduction of the bill into parliament?

What if BTC is not within the selected coins that will be allowed, would that mean it will be banned from India, meaning trading, holding and mining would be illegal like in China? 

If that happens, that would probably cause a massive sell-off as it happened with China’s ban, correct? Or is the rest of the world kind of protected and that will only happen within Indian exchanges as it happened during this week when many coins fell approximately in average a 20%?

I appreciate any answer that could clarify my doubts and any recommendations, like wether to sell BTC now and wait for the deeper dip to probably double my holdings like it happened with China, or to hold, which at this moment and given my doubts seems very scary.

Just to start off, I get that people want to make money, but recently I have felt that the majority has become investors and not crypto anarchists...which in my personal opinion could ruin the entire purpose of crypto.

To sum everything I want to talk about up, investing in CRO or other BANK coins is ridiculous to me. Being happy about crypto.com taking over the name for whatever basketball stadium, institutions offering crypto, etc. is CRAZY. The whole point of Bitcoin and crypto was to avoid banks in general. Instead, we are cheering on the same banks that put our economies in such a shit place world wide that coders from all over the world gathered together (satoshi’s coders) and created Bitcoin, a crypto currency to escape from involving banks in any and every digital transaction…seriously guys, what. the. f##K. Banks will literally charge you an eat shit fee of $40.00 because you don't have money in ONE of your accounts....that's who you want to take over crypto? That's who you are cheering on?

What I think we need to remember is banks love control… So investing in BANK’s coins, is the worst possible solution for crypto currency working properly. For God’s sake, majority of people own a chunk of BNB so they can buy shit coins. YOU give banks control by making them and their coins highest priority, higher priority than Polkadot or Cardano (literally BNB is worth more....HOW?!). Blows my mind Binance coin is f\*\***king THIRD on the charts. Might as well just keep your money in a bank and invest in stocks…because the whole point of Bitcoin was to say, we've got this currency, and NO ONE should be able to track down if I sent my mom $10,000 of it. That's the whole point, f**\*\*\* KYC rules and f\*\*\* banks opening more and more exchanges, making their name stand out by buying out stadiums and advertising literally everywhere. F\*\*\* those places. Because one day, when we least expect it, they will give our governments a ""gift bundle"" of millions or billions of dollars to pass a law that only allows you to use CRO or BNB or KuCoin to purchase things. You think Bitcoin will be a legal tender? I would LOVE that. But the only reason it was headed in that direction was because banks weren't involved. NOW they are because they realize the potential this space has to offer and MOST PEOPLE are putting their savings into CRO and BNB because it's the most familiar....because it's advertised EVERYWHERE. God sakes, Binance is probably pumping a bunch of sh*t coins that requires BNB to buy them so MORE people buy BNB to either hold or buy sh*tcoins with it...it's common sense. If there is no demand for Binance Coin, create demand. ""Hey, these 100 shitcoins can easily be purchased with BNB but any other way, you'll probably lose your money on the way, just play it safe, use BNB."" I cannot emphasize enough that we are all being played because banks finally showed up to the party and we are only going to be the host of our own party for a little bit longer because all these newbies are just putting their money where they feel comfortable putting it. ""Bitcoin won't double, but CRO just did and its 1% of Bitcoins Marketcap"", ""NO, JUST PUT IT IN A SOLID PROJECT THAT IS INTENDED FOR CRYPTO NOT MADE BY BANKS...please.""

Right now, we're free from these banks and our governments controlling the entire market. But if you don't invest your money wisely, soon they will have us by the F\*\*king balls and the entire crypto space will be run by banks and all of this was pointless...

Someone asked me before, ""What happens when governments receive a large bribe and pass a law stating you can no longer hold your money in wallets but exchanges only?"" 'WELL THAT WOULD SUCK, but we would probably get a certain amount of time to move that crypto over before either the wallets no longer exist or the government/banks would deem it ""too late"" because now we have to show all this bullshit on our taxes so they can easily see when you moved it over and if it was moved before the deadline, if they will charge you a fee for moving it after that deadline or if they just go ""nah it's worthless, but we'll keep it. bye now"" AND THE BEST PART? BANKS RUN THOSE EXCHANGES, congrats we will be doing a full circle back to 2008 where a crash will take all of our hard earned money because banks will do anything and everything to make money even if it means fucking over all of your investors....but the banks will get out perfectly fine because they are the foundation of the entire f\*\*king economy so they need to be bailed out...absolutely insane'

So back in 2017 I was trying to get into bitcoin and didn't really know anybody else into it.  So I signed up for a wallet and had about .05 or so of Bitcoin. I had a particular wallet that when I signed up for said said to write down these 12 random words. I figured ""well I'll lose the password if it's on a piece of paper; I'll screenshot these words instead."" Well 2 months later my phone was dead and sadly I took it to the store, they wiped the phone and I did not get those screenshots back. I reached out to the wallet company themselves they said:

""*Your wallet is stored only in your phone, and the information required to restore it is presented to you in the form of your paper key. None of your personal information is shared with us, including your wallet and paper key.*

*Unfortunately, if you do not have your paper key or the original wallet still installed, there is nothing we can do.""*

&gt;Strikingly, net worth is still mostly tangible. While investment in intangible assets has grown relative to investment in tangible assets in many countries when broadly measured, under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence. On paper, intellectual property products make up less than 4 percent of global net worth and real assets. Intangibles do, however, generate economic returns. The OECD reported in 2015 that intangible assets had expected returns of 24 percent, the highest rate among produced asset categories.

my first question is specific. **what does this sentence mean**: ""under current accounting standards, intellectual property—including research and development, software, and original artworks—is assumed to rapidly lose its value to competition and obsolescence."" **what are you investing in, when you invest in google, if not in the value of its intellectual property?** i realize google has not been around for very long, in the grand scheme of things, but it would be quite a surprise if it weren't still a major player in five years, no?

now my questions start to get vague.

if you read someone like buffett or sam altman, you leave thinking that only productive things are valuable (buffett likes a sure linear function; altman likes a possible exponential function), but that is obviously in some sense absurd, not just because valuable things are also valuable, but also because it is not at all clear that there is a clear distinction between things that are valuable for being productive and those that are valuable for having a personal canon of historical value. (indeed, altman does make caveats for land, even at the crescendi of his [hymn to productivity](https://moores.samaltman.com/).) again, from the mckinsey report:

&gt;The global economy has undergone a vast transformation over the past two decades, as rapid technological progress including digitization has taken hold and investment in intangible assets has soared. Yet over this same period, global wealth has grown largely as a result of the rising value of household real estate, a historical store of value

my rough read (very possible that this is not just a simplification, but downright inaccurate) is that they (mckinsey) basically attribute this discrepancy to loose monetary policy — i.e., it has been, on average, easier to increase net worth by taking out a loan, buying a tangible/valuable thing, and paying off that loan, than by buying an intangible/productive thing.

**but then why are all the largest companies in the world precisely those that principally (?) own intangible/productive things (tech)?**

i read [something](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/) recently that includes a lemma (see the ""Scratching the surface"" section), referencing another [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3667309), to the effect that the housing valuations in 2008 were in some sense *not* inflated, insofar as the run-up basically amounted to an increasingly accurate assessment, on the demand side, of the intrinsic (even *productive*) value of living in certain properties.

i think the best tl;dr, here, is that i am becoming increasingly suspicious of the distinction, which seems pervasive (especially the higher up you go in the intellectual totem pole), between speculation, on the one hand, and investment in productive/technological assets, on the other.

not really done with this, but [no one gives us any time any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khnokW3Mw24), so i'm just going to post it and make edits/clarifications later.

#### P.S.

 i think some of the impetus for this post was simply my brain balking at the statement that intellectual property products (including all software) make up only 4% of global net worth. i am also having trouble understanding why the valuation of (or: the net worth held in) real estate would not diminish in proportion to the difference between (a) the average rate of return on real estate (rent + capital gain)[1] and (b) the average rate of return on intangibles (24%, according to that first quotation in the original post).

[1] just found another long-term [article](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1225/5435538) on this topic:

&gt;In terms of total returns, residential real estate and equities have shown very similar and high real total gains, on average about 7% a year. Housing outperformed equities before World War II. Since World War II, equities have outperformed housing on average but had much higher volatility and higher synchronicity with the business cycle. The observation that housing returns are similar to equity returns, but much less volatile, is puzzling. Like Shiller (2000), we find that long-run capital gains on housing are relatively low, around 1% a year in real terms, and considerably lower than capital gains in the stock market. However, the rental yield component is typically considerably higher and more stable than the dividend yield of equities so that total returns are of comparable magnitude.

more concretely, page A25, table A19 of a third [article](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/qje/134/3/10.1093_qje_qjz012/1/qjz012_supplemental_appendix.pdf?Expires=1640194258&amp;Signature=KMtwxYshgxY4XJDCivdvlmRkrpJilDCRNnTItdOggrNsb8FlVD-M6saSiU-FTh2lJlbTS2evJvF0q~lcld90bR0Q7-gGuzbBGIj7KBWTSPcvEH0yLK~9s1O8mEfTddVbxEri48l1OTWTGZ18p3sNjU7MNoHWTGZ7GVh5lGBT40W~jbLtyQZpHuBj6FYFrtC2FCOVEj4b9fC9l5m0CAztwEK3rbWe5ndBY66tL7t7yN8Q6aNM-Va6B3d3RO0UN2~0ot6WhZGsncdXfTY8AlRmRThCofYpOWRMG5pzdU0JrOIcE97ZH6dFFMeovTerbo63VAUGL72N0ktCbJhGXRncxA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) article puts long-term, average rental yield at 5.33%. elsewhere this same article cites figures closer to 4%. the real capital gain on real estate, on the other hand, is only 0.90% (same table). so the most naive version of my question in my original post could be something like: if the average return on real estate is, say, 7%, and the average return on ""intangibles"" (tech, IP, etc.) is on average 24% — why hasn't all liquidity moved into intangibles? (Or: why is as much or more net worth still tied to real estate (see page 9 of the mckinsey [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/the%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20the%20global%20balance%20sheet%20how%20productively%20are%20we%20using%20our%20wealth/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-nov-2021-full-report_final.pdf), specifically the chart titled ""Net worth has grown much faster than GDP since 2000, with variations by country"")?)",3575003,value vs. expected return,0,1.0,2021-11-18 18:45:18,POSITIVE,0.8461476564407349

Perhaps the next challenge for bitcoin should become a side-chain for smart-contracts? What do you think?",3569535,Bitcoin Taproot and competition with ethereum,0,1.0,2021-11-17 11:29:49,POSITIVE,0.6476853489875793

So I wondered if 90% had already been reached: not yet, so I calculated what day the bitcoin that adds up to 90% will be mined, and it coincides with Christmas day!

For the curious,  the calculations:

90% of 21M = 18,900,000 bitcoins, will be reached in block #715,715 (630,000 + 85,715): 210,000 \* (50 + 25 + 12.5) + 85,715 \* 6.25 = 18,900,004 bitcoin. Block #710,118 was mined on Nov 17 at 11:00 GMT. 5597 blocks remaining / 144 (blocks/day) = 38.8 days = 25th to 26th Dec., a few hours should be subtracted by the current upward trend of the hashrate.

CZ and Binance benefited from a low regulation environment to grow to massive scale now they want governments to introduce regulation to prevent competitors from popping up and dethroning them.

CZ even admits to it in the article by saying:

&gt;""Binance welcomes regulations for many reasons. One of those minor reasons is a selfish reason: that in a regulated industry, the few larger players will remain. The smaller players do get cut off, which is unfortunate for those guys.""

If you enjoy smaller independent exchanges or want less AML and KYC then CZ is going to try to shut them down through the power of the government and monopolize the exchange industry.

In light of this monopolistic and antifreedom rhetoric I invite you all to join me and **boycott Binance**.

If you would like some alternative then for simple fiat to Bitcoin on-ramping I suggest [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) \- a P2P DEX with no KYC, open source.

Another option for fiat to Bitcoin, especially useful if you don't want to install anything, is [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/) they're non-custodial and P2P also often have better rates than Bisq in my experience, typically no KYC but depends on your trading partner.

Finally for shitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin conversions I suggest you check out [FixedFloat](https://fixedfloat.com/) they support Lightning ⚡, have low fees, no KYC, not even a sign up is needed.

The big fish want max pain. Note the 20 week moving average is right about 62-63k.. Historically the november rally takes place after thanksgiving. Before that there is a max pain. A way to get the most holders to sell their bitcoin to the big fish.

 In 2017 Bitcoin rose 230% after Thanksgving to the end of the year. That is where we are at now in the market cycle its the year after the halving like what happened in 2016-2017..  
It was the last really parapolic run that we had that can be compared to what we are about to see. Yes 12k to 60k In less than 2 months last year was quite something,And bitcoin in 2017 did the same at its start of the year. Then there was a pull back, then consolidation, then the big rally to complete the leg up. Thats what we are about to go into and I will freely take anyones bitcoin if they want to get rid of it.

 So this dip happening now is what I like to call the ""Set Up"" This is what the hedge funds are playing. The first part is to shake out the weak hands and liquidate the long posistions. Cause a catalyst to drop the brice of bitcoin. What I believe the hedges are playing is the MT Gox flooding the supply of bitcoin in about 4 days.

Whether it will prove transitory or secular remains to be seen, but it will continue to be an aspect for consideration to all investors and savers going forward. In light of today's current debate around supply chain disruptions, quantitative easing, and persistent fiscal deficits, I would like to reflect on a paper I wrote earlier this year advising investors (particularly institutional ones), to ensure that they had appropriate inflation hedges given the existing macro backdrop. My point here is not to suggest that my concerns have been fully vindicated, but rather to provide insights into the reality that large inflationary bursts were predictable and that the strategies I outlined remain relevant. In the interest of transparency, I have made a few grammatical updates, added in a few more links, but have refrained from updating any of the paper's core assumptions and thesis. I enjoyed re-reading and reflecting on this writing as an endeavor to better understand where we are in the world today, and most importantly, how to stay prepared for the future.

I'd also like to say while this is my first article publishing, I hope to continue with a series of less formal writings pertaining to traditional investing and economic concepts, as well as Bitcoin. Hope anyone interested in taking about 20-30 minutes to read enjoys it, and I'm always open to feedback!

What I Think I Know

Mining is the process of adding blocks to the blockchain. New blocks are created by miners and added to the blockchain after completing a Proof of Work.

The Proof of Work is guessing a number (Nonce) that, when added to the end of the block header and hashed twice using SHA256, results in a number smaller than the Difficulty.

Once a block is mined, the Proof of Work is verified by other nodes by hashing the block header twice using SHA256 and checking the value is smaller than the Difficulty.

The block header (before being hashed), consists of the following:

Version + Previous Block Hash + Merkle Root + Timestamp + Difficulty + Nonce

What I’m Confused About

I would like to verify a mined block, but I don’t understand how to put together the block header.

Example:

Block 277316

Version: 0x2
Previous Hash: 0000000000000002a7bbd25a417c0374cc55261021e8a9ca74442b01284f0569
Merkle Root: c91c008c26e50763e9f548bb8b2fc323735f73577effbc55502c51eb4cc7cf2e
Timestamp: 2013-12-27 18:11
Difficulty: 
1,180,923,195.26
Bits: 419,668,748
Nonce: 
924,591,752

Block Hash: 0000000000000001b6b9a13b095e96db41c4a928b97ef2d944a9b31b2cc7bdc4

I don’t get what format all the parts of the block header need to be to create the block hash successfully. I’ve also heard that the previous hash and Merkle Root need to be reversed? 

Can someone break down what the correct block header input to SHA256(SHA256()) for Block 277316 is?

Thanks!

Let's first say I'm a bitcoin holder and i do think i will hold it for decades.

I'm actually doing dca and a buying 1000usd x month.

I would like to improve my strategy just to get more bitcoins for my future. 
Here's what i was thinking i could do:
- keep holding
- when get 20 or 10 % of profits, sell 50% of btc, so take half profit
- from that moment keep dca but now doing 1000usd monthly like original and adding 1000usd x week until what I sold has been re-converted again in btc, so it would be a little more because of a small part of profit.

What do you think? Until now i just have been a sleepy hodler, i would like to get something more.

Yesterday, he [submitted into evidence](https://youtu.be/SJpj0zj35zQ) an email he says was from Dave Kleiman to Uyen Nguyen asking her to be a director of his 'bitcoin company' in **late 2012**.

It is provably fake.

**Craig didn't realize that the email's PGP signature includes a signing timestamp along with the ID of the key used as metadata.** Was the email actually sent **in 2012**? Let's find out!

The beginning of the signature is as follows: iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJTH+uQAAoJELiFsXrEW+0bCacH/3K

Converted to hex, it's: 89 01 1c 04 01 01 02 00 06 05 02 *53 1f eb 90* 00 0a 09 10 **b8 85 b1 7a c4 5b ed 1b** 09 a7 07 ff 72

We [know](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880) how to find the long ID of the key used and the timestamp of the signature. I've bolded the ID and italicized the timestamp. Looking on the MIT keyserver, we can [find the fake\* key](https://i.imgur.com/5ooGihN.png). **The timestamp of the signature is 1394600848, which is March 12, 2014, two weeks before Craig filed to install Uyen as a director of Dave's old company, and almost a year after Dave died!**

We can double-check with gpg -vv  
. Transcribe the email and paste it in. Here's the output:

    :signature packet: algo 1, keyid B885B17AC45BED1B version 4, created 1394600848, md5len 0, sigclass 0x01 digest algo 2, begin of digest 09 a7 hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2014-03-12) subpkt 16 len 8 (issuer key ID B885B17AC45BED1B)

One weekend, over a month ago, I had this weird idea of building a automated BTC trading bot. That weekend, I downloaded python coding platform and started my journy. To put things into perspective, I had 0 coding experience prior to this thought. 

I love to set challenges for myself, and this was by far one of the bigger ones I had set. I spent the last month working on the bot - maybe 3 hours a day and slightly more on the weekends - and I have finally launched it! The bot went live this morning, I am running it off my desktop pc but plan to move it to my laptop later today for  efficiency reasons.

After I launched it, I sat staring at the program for about 20mins xD in hope that it would make a trade. It has not traded yet but I am eagerly waiting to see if it works.

My thesis on creating this bot was to try build a sound trading stratergy that would net me small extra % of sats and just hold it forever. I am not looking for major gains right now, small sats now might be huge gains later on you know!

Let me know if  you are intersted in my progress? If so, I will provide a update later on once it has completed two or three trades. Hopefully they net me some sats instead of losing them xD.

It's been more than half a year with headaches before I now decided to go public.
Bitfinex has frozen my account after a withdrawal request of about 2.1 BTC in February. By my standards that is a huge amount of money. Money I would have never dreamed of when starting with crypto to be honest. Back in the days (my account is multiple years old now) I used to trade crypto to crypto only. I have never encountered any problems concerning deposits and withdrawals at bitfinex back then. I probably wasn't anyone special to them because I was only juggling around a couple of thousand dollars a year (depending on the crypto prices).

Anyways, as we all know crypto prices rose immensely in the beginning of this year. That was when I decided to withdraw my coins. Upon request they claimed to have frozen the account because of an automated KYC procedure. As much as I understand it, you would only need to verify if you started trading fiat currencies. I did not do that. However, I thought it might just be some security feature to protect me as the account owner. After all, this wasn't ""peanuts"" anymore and because it was (and is) so much money for me I happily agreed to verify.

Since then I ran through an odysse of providing documents and declarations of all kinds. Some of them were super private.
They wanted me to proof my identity, which I did. The standard procedure with passport and proof of address.

After that they wanted a proof, where I got the very first coins from that I deposited many years ago. Those coins they never cared about for so many years while letting me do many deposits and withdrawals in the meantime.
Since I originally bought those bitcoins 6 years ago together with my old roommate that was quite a task. We found the transaction and sent them all necessary files and transaction data.

But not enough. I now had to proof that he was actually my roommate, which was quite difficult too because we don't live together anymore. Because of data protection regulations the landlord from back then needed a signed request from both of us in order to hand out the proof to me. (It's no joke, GDPR is taken serious in Germany.)
To clarify: I verified myself and my old room mate. I did not forge any documents and I did not lie anywhere throughout the process.

I finally send them the proof from the landlord.
Not enough again. I now had to proof that I went to school with that roommate. So both of us had to send them our school certificates also.
Not enough again. They suddenly started asking me about other withdrawals from 3 years ago. I proofed that I sold the crypto for cash and transferred the cash to my bank account a week later.

After that, they told me to wait again. That was almost 2 weeks ago. No reply.

I'm just so tired of this. Just angry, exhausted and worried. By now, they probably know more about me than most of my friends and family. Financially and in general. Plus they have copies of my entire identity from A to Z. At the beginning I thought it's really just a way to prevent my account from getting robbed but after all I'm just worried about their real intentions.

Please give me back my account and stop this shady practice.

institutions inevitably need to arbitrate disputes, fully irrevocable transactions are not practically possible. The cost of arbitration adds to the transaction

costs, limiting the minimum actual transaction amount and thus eliminating the possibility of daily small transactions, and because irrevocable payments are not supported, the cost of irrevocable services is limited.

and as irrevocable payments are not supported, it will cost more to pay for irrevocable services. As there is the possibility of transactions being reversed, the need for trust will be more widespread.

The need for trust will become more widespread. Merchants must be wary of their customers and bother them with more information than is necessary.

information. A certain percentage of fraud is considered inevitable. While these costs can be avoided by using physical money in person and

uncertainty of payment, there is no mechanism for making payments over a communication channel without introducing a trusted party.

What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic principles rather than trust, which allows any willing party to transact directly without the need for trust.

The system would allow any willing party to transact directly without the need for a trusted third party. The transaction would be computationally irrevocable to protect the seller from fraud and to protect the buyer.

The programmed contractual mechanisms used to protect buyers should also be easier to implement. In this paper, we propose

a solution to the double payment problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational evidence for time-based transaction sequences.

double payment problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational evidence for time-based transaction sequences. As long as the CPU arithmetic under the collective control of honest nodes is greater than the CPU arithmetic of each cooperating group of attacking nodes, the system is secure.

the system is secure as long as the CPU arithmetic under the collective control of the honest nodes is greater than the CPU arithmetic of each group of cooperating attack nodes.

We consider the case of an attacker trying to generate an alternative chain that is faster than the honest chain. Even if this goal is achieved, the

It would not make the system open to arbitrary modification, such as creating currency out of thin air or taking money that does not belong to him. Nodes will not accept

accept invalid transactions as payment, and an honest node will never accept a block containing an invalid transaction. An attacker can only

may change one of his own transactions to get back the money he has already spent a while ago.

The competition between the honest chain and the attacker chain can be described as a binomial random walk. The success event is that the honest node is extended by one

block and the gap between the two chains is added by 1. The failure event is that the attacker's chain is extended by one block and the gap between the two chains is subtracted by 1.

The probability of the attacker catching up with the honest chain from a certain backward position is similar to the gambler's bankruptcy theory. Imagine a gambler with infinite trust

A gambler with infinite trust starts with a certain loss and makes potentially infinite gambles to try to break even. We can calculate his probability of reaching

break-even, i.e. the probability of an attacker catching the honest chain, as follows \[8\]

p = probability that the honest node finds the next block

q = probability that the attacker finds the next block

qz = probability that the attacker catches up to the honest chain from z blocks behind

We assume that p &gt; q. The probability will decrease exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker needs to catch up increases. Since the situation is in his

is not favourable, if he is not lucky enough to catch up quickly early on, his chances of catching up become slimmer the further he falls behind.

We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction has to wait to ensure that the payer can no longer change that transaction. We

We assume that the payer is trying to convince the recipient that he has paid for the time being, and then after a period of time changes to pay back himself.

At this point the payee will receive a warning, but the payer hopes that it is too late.

The payee generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the payer so that the payer cannot sign the transaction in advance. This

prevents the payer from preparing a blockchain in advance by continuing to work until he is lucky enough to get a big lead and then

then executing the transaction. Once the transaction has been sent, the dishonest payer starts secretly working on a parallel chain containing his replacement transaction.

Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest payer begins to secretly work on a parallel chain containing his replacement transaction.

The recipient waits until the transaction is added to the block and z blocks are subsequently appended. He does not know the exact progress of the attacker.

But assuming that honest blocks are generated in the desired average time, the attacker's possible progress will be a Poisson distribution with the expected

expected value is.

To calculate the probability that the attacker can still catch up now, we give the Poisson density of each possible progress he can reach multiplied by the probability that he can catch up at

probability that that progress will catch up with the honest chain.

Summary

We have proposed a trust-independent system for electronic transactions. We started with a universal system of digitally signed currencies.

This system provides strong ownership control, but is imperfect due to the lack of a method to prevent double payments. To address this

problem, we propose a peer-to-peer network that uses proof-of-work to record the history of public transactions, and as long as honest nodes

As long as honest nodes control most of the CPU computational power, the transaction history will quickly become computationally immutable to the attacker. The network

Robust due to its structural simplicity. Nodes require very little coordination to work simultaneously. They do not need to be authenticated, as messages are not sent to a particular location.

messages are not sent to a particular location, they are simply propagated as best they can. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at any time, and

They only need to accept the longest proof-of-work chain as evidence of the events that occurred when they left. Nodes use CPU arithmetic to vote

vote, expressing their acceptance by committing to extending valid blocks and their resistance by refusing to work on invalid blocks.

by refusing to work on invalid blocks. Any rules and incentives needed can be reinforced by this consensus mechanism.

Hello there fellow Redditors!

As suggested by the title, I need help finding a service that is fully-anonymous and on the Clearnet to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies and USD (I want to be able to synchronize or ""add a payment,"" my debit card to the wallet and store dollars there in the meanwhile, most preferably be able to store dollars on it similarly to a checking account). Can you please list a few services that can do this?

I also wanted to ask in regards to cryptex ([https://cryptex.net/](https://cryptex.net/)) and whether or not it is a legitimate service to use (if it is legitimate, it seems to meet my standards so pleas LMK)!

Finally, I wanted to get some suggestions for legitimate crypto wallets out in the darkweb and how to safely transfer money from my anonymous Clearnet wallet to my darkweb wallet.

Should I hold my cash until we are back to the NEUTRAL or FEAR in the Fear and Greed Index? Or should I just keep my DCA strategy regardless of the movement of the price?

Crypto is the new WAVE. I truly believe in innovating for the benefit of humanity and crypto has the chance to do that.

Here's another good quote about, imo, patience: **""\[T\]ime... innovateth greatly, but quietly, and by degrees scarce to be percieved.""** I think even if people don't see the benefits right now, however many years it takes but those same people, I hope, will warm up to and understand the idea of what some crypto's are trying to achieve.

Anyway, Saylor was just interviewed on Pomp’s show and said some very interesting things about a Bitcoin future in the next 10-30 years.

I’m still a maximalist, but I don’t think hyperbitcoinization will be seen in the next 10-30 years.

Perhaps not even in my lifetime.

To sum up:

-	There’s over 100 sovereign currencies. Dozens of countries use USD and many more peg their currencies to USD. We will see a currency consolidation in which only a few are left (USD, Yuan, Euro).
-	Banks and the US government will issue stable coins running on bitcoin/lightning payment rails to transfer USD across the world at the speed of light. This is *good* for USD and USD acceptance worldwide.
-	The bond market won’t die either. Governments will hold BTC on their balance sheet and issue BTC backed bonds.
-	Converting to a BTC unit of account is *insanely* costly and time consuming for businesses. By his metrics, converting his company’s balance sheet, assets, payroll, receivables/payables to BTC would cost him over **a billion dollars and 10 years to complete**. USD is not being replaced by BTC anytime soon.
-	OR a company can simply *add* BTC to their balance sheet as an asset to hold. This incentivizes *holding* BTC rather than *doing business in* BTC.
-	Hundreds of trillions of dollars are locked up in financial systems, and will take decades to unwind and move into BTC, and that’s dependent on a shift in accounting and investment thesis.
-	Accounting practices need to change to account for BTC as a holding on the balance sheet.
-	BTC will **not** be the only asset. Businesses will still have buildings, inventory, vehicles, software, hardware, etc.
-	BTC will serve as a global asset for every human being to store their wealth/purchasing power, but will not *replace* USD or legacy financial systems for a very long time.
-	Hoping for the collapse of fiat is hoping for the collapse of the U.S., China, and Europe. It would cause massive pain for millions of people.

I’d like to hear your thoughts on Saylor’s point of view and if this has changed your opinion of him.

I always thought he had a very esoteric maximalist view of BTC that it’ll swallow every facet of the financial system and that the dollar will collapse in 10 years.

Turns out I was wrong and he’s very pragmatic in is approach to BTC from a CEOs perspective.

Got a tenant moving out, woo hoo!!!!  So I'm going to have a vacant house soon, and need to know what to do with it. 

Unfortunately most of my rentals are tenants that have been there a long time, and their rent rate is really yesteryear's rate.  But my property taxes, insurance, contractor invoices, construction materials, etc., are all at current rates.  Add in the eviction moratorium which only ended a couple months ago, and the truth is, if I do rent this thing out, I'm going to have to POP the rent.  

So here's my options: 

1. Rent it and bump the rent up big time, and over the next year or so use the higher rent to DCA into more Bitcoin.  The risks here are pretty high - what if there's another moratorium?  What if my costs go up much faster than I can keep the rent bumped?  What if the tenant really stiffs me hard and tears the place up, etc.  What if Bitcoin goes way up in price during that time (likely), so I won't be able to accumulate as much.  
2. Sell it for dollars, then upon closing buy as much Bitcoin as possible.  This makes the sale easy, but then what happens if Bitcoin price goes up just while we're waiting for the close?  Very possible, and I'd get a whole lot less Bitcoin than what I thought I'd get when I signed the sales contract.  Also, how to move a large amount of dollars into Bitcoin?  The KYC stuff from the exchanges might be more work and stress than I'd like, and I have gotten to where I don't trust exchanges AT ALL ([Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) screwed me out of 2.3 million sats but that's another story).  So, I don't like this option so much. 
3. Sell it for straight Bitcoin.  As in, the Bitcoin goes to my wallet, and I give the buyer the keys and garage remote at closing.  Simple as that.  Let the other closing costs all be in dollars, but the sale itself be in Bitcoin.  Something like that, just structure the sales contract in that manner.  The difficulty would be in getting the buyer (and my agent) to understand why I'm structuring the contract in this way and allow them to be comfortable going ahead with it.  It may come across as extremely weird?  But the point is, this works best for me if I'm going to sell it!  For the simple reason that, I know how much hard money I'm going to walk with, when I sign the sales contract.

My nonprofit organization, Learn Fresh (EIN-45-1059457), is running a crypto donation campaign to fund the development of our Math Hoops mobile app! The product is free to download for all kids worldwide and focuses on math learning through the game of basketball. We launched the Math Hoops program in 2013 and have reached over 375,000 students to date.

Our newly developed app will help us reach millions of independent students and families around the world while enhancing the overall program experience. Students work with real-time NBA and WNBA stats to compete in simulated basketball games, and our team is building out multiplayer and league functionality to connect young learners around the world.

Funding a tech product is always hard as a nonprofit, so we’d love your support to help make this project sustainable. Keep in mind, We are NOT funded by the NBA, we just have licensed the right to use player stats and team names. Our goal is to raise 10 BTC to fund the completion of the app. Thank you all for your consideration of our work! We accept a range of cryptocurrencies through Giving Block.

There is a lot of free and ""green"" energy in space. We cannot harvest it yet, because   
a) it's expensive to launch things into space,  
b) there is no way to transport the energy back to earth.  
The cool thing about Bitcoin is, almost unlike anything else it only needs the first problem to be solved to take advantage of this energy. And there are a lot of companies which work on lowering the cost of space launches drastically (not only spacex, read about Spinlaunch for exampe).

Bitcoin will go where the energy is cheapest and this is obviously space (maybe not *to the* *moon*, but stratosphere for sure).

Since this energy does not have to be transported to generate income, I see a potential race for space bitcoin mining.

I have the feeling that this could (and if nothing goes wrong definitely *will)* be huge.  
Bitcoin could go 100% green, but there seem to be a lot of downside to it.  
Will POW still be superior to POS and other solutions?I mean even if it's cheap only big players will able to afford a space mine.  
Or only really progressive thinking and global DAOs? Exciting times ahead.

So my question: do you have (had) any thoughts about it or can you point me to someone who already thought and talked about it?

&amp;#x200B;

　　 However, in the Bitcoin world, it is business as usual to a large extent, and bullish beliefs are intact. In sharp contrast, fluctuations of this magnitude usually trigger tension in traditional markets. In early London trading on Friday, Bitcoin fell 0.5% to around $57,280, the sixth consecutive day of decline.

&amp;#x200B;

　　 ""Bitcoin correction is no big deal,"" wrote Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at online foreign exchange broker Oanda. Although the drop to $50,000 ""will represent a significant correction from the high point, it is relatively trivial considering the gains in recent months.""

&amp;#x200B;

　　 Some analysts said that it is normal for prices to retreat sharply after a 40% surge in October. New U.S. tax filing regulations deemed unfriendly to cryptocurrency investors have also worsened market sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

　　 ""During the Bitcoin winter of 2016 and 2017, what really made cryptocurrency lose momentum was the rise in interest rates and the loss of liquidity from the system,"" said Jamie Cox, financial consultant and managing partner of Harris Financial Group.

&amp;#x200B;

　　 20% or higher price fluctuations are not uncommon in cryptocurrencies. After setting a record of nearly $65,000 in early April, Bitcoin fell by more than 50% before the end of June, and then moved higher again. After hitting nearly $53,000 in early September, it fell by about 25% in the following weeks.

Here are things I've learned over the past 6 years:

1. The Reality - If you're just getting into BTC and feel like you've missed it, you haven't. Less than 4% of the population owns BTC, and among those 95% don't understand exactly what it is. If you take an hour every day for a week to focus on understanding it, you'll be in the top 5% of holders. Learn about the underlying tech, cryptography, and market dynamics. 

2. Many Small Make Big - Smart money in BTC are accumulating over time. This means buying consistently over time. (I recommend automatic monthly/weekly buys on an exchange so you don't have to worry about it) It can be $5/month, or $500/month. Whatever you can feel comfortable losing and what works well in your situation, do that. Overambitious allocations will make you feel stretched and is a bad idea as you'll likely sell to avoid loss. Slow and steady over the course of years. 

3. Time - If you're serious about BTC after learning about its purpose, you should be okay with waiting decades for results. The way I think about it, is once I buy BTC, the money is gone. Now I don't think BTC will go to $0 or anything like that, but it makes it easy to keep it over such a long period of time. The idea is that BTC will be so ingrained in the future, that you won't need to sell it and convert to fiat, it will be a widely accepted asset like gold, that you sell as you need, like retirement. 

4. Market Manipulation - You need to accept and understand that there is market manipulation in BTC. Through news, price action, and whales. How you avoid it is by understanding the end goal. Buy the dips, and don't sell. I know some incredibly successful BTC traders, and all of them factor in that this is not a fair market in the short term. If you're accumulating and are a long-term Hodler, you won't be impacted long-term. 

5. Regulation - You need to understand how the U.S governments and other governments will attempt to regulate the space, and how that plays a direct role in the future of the economy, taxes, and power. Michael Saylor talks about this a lot and I think it's a legitimate factor. If the U.S bans BTC will you have to sell? No, you won't. If the U.S tries to take BTC like they stole gold from citizens in 1933 can they do it again with BTC? No, that's what makes blockchain special. I urge everyone to understand the power that BTC puts in the hands of the people, and what it does for democratizing wealth and opportunity for minorities and the financially lower class. 

6. Network - Start building your personal network with people who are in the space or have been in the space longer than you have. I can not tell you how much wisdom I've received from people within this community that have to lead to amazing successes and opportunity. 

If you've read this far, I hope I've given you new info and helped you understand the space a little better. Feel free to follow my profile or shoot me a DM for any questions.",3579058,Some advice from a veteran of the space,0,1.0,2021-11-19 19:25:58,POSITIVE,0.9878528118133545

1. so wie ich es verstanden habe werden bei jeder transaktion ein kleiner teil verbrannt
2. Es ist nicht mehr aktraktiv für miner und es wird weniger gehandelt, dadurch an beliebtheit verlieren.( Die woanders durch auch gewonnen wird vermute ich mal)
3. Da man bei eth dann nichtmehr die möglichkeit hat diese auf ne cold wallet zu packen sind die anfällig für Hacker.( punkto Quantencomputer )

Understood case in court is still ongoing in Florida.  


When you guys think jury will reach a verdict?  


If Craig wright is found guilty and has to pay the victims that is Dave Kleiman's family then Kleiman's family is entitled to half a million 500,000 bitcoins correct? This is 50% custody of Satoshi's Bitcoins.  


Where can we see this Satoshi wallet address with over 1 million bitcoins in there on the bitcoin explorer/chain?  


If Craig is found guilty and soon after that we can see on the blockchain that over 1 million bitcoins amount in that wallet has decreased then that proves Craig Wright is the real Satoshi Nakamoto and has the private keys to this wallet?  


Hasn't Kleiman's family lawyer who is representing them advised the Kleimans that once its proven that Craig Wright is to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto then bitcoin will crash to $0 meaning that court case that they filed and sue Craig Wright for will be for nothing because 500,000 bitcoins will be worthless so what's the point of the case?      


Craig Wright is rich so if Craig Wright loses how is it settled with the Kleiman's family? 500,000 bitcoins or Craig settles it with his own cash? Does the judge decide or Kleiman's family decides how its settled?  


**So in conclusion the only way we find out if Craig Wright is the real Satoshi Nakamoto is if he loses the court case and the judge orders him to give Kleiman's family over 500,000 bitcoins and we can see the 1.1 Million bitcoins in Satoshi Wallet has decreased a lot in amount of bitcoins in there after the case is finished?**

Did you know that there is a relationship between the Earth's Moon and the crypto market? I just discovered this phenomenon and I wanted to share it with you all. To be clear, I do not believe that the Moon is directly influencing BTC's price. I just find this phenomenon to be an interesting coincidence.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at the phases of the Moon mapped onto a 24hr candlestick chart for Bitcoin in 2021:

[BTC &amp; Moon Phases 2021](https://preview.redd.it/r19fkoexet081.png?width=1469&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdf1c05b0466f5780db7cfc0cb03fd3e9aeeb27)

\[[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8Wag80Nk-Bitcoin-2021-Moon-Cycles-crypto-luca/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8Wag80Nk-Bitcoin-2021-Moon-Cycles-crypto-luca/)\]([https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8Wag80Nk-Bitcoin-2021-Moon-Cycles-crypto-luca/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/8Wag80Nk-Bitcoin-2021-Moon-Cycles-crypto-luca/))

&amp;#x200B;

Now its clear to see that the Moon phases do not line up perfectly with Bitcoin's tops and bottoms, but its \*damn\* close. The general pattern that I'm recognizing, is that BTC is bullish when the Moon is waning, and bearish when the Moon is waxing. Moon wanes, BTC waxes and vice verse.

&amp;#x200B;

I also wanted to point out that BTC's price movement did deviate from this trend more so in October than any other month this year. However, we are seeing a possible bottom of this month lining up near-perfectly with November's full Moon.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this Moon phase trend is not a TA indicator for BTC's price movement. On the other hand, its pretty wild that one could have bought on the full Moon and sold on the new Moon all year and be sitting with a decent profit. Nevertheless, I just found this relationship between Bitcoin and the phases of the Moon to be very interesting and I thought you guys might too!",3582905,Bitcoin and the Moon Phases,0,1.0,2021-11-20 21:07:49,NEGATIVE,0.9851917028427124

- **Bitcoin Audible** - This podcast was pivotal to my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. It is narrated by Guy Swann and he reads Bitcoin related works and articles. At the end of most of his episodes he has a ""Guy's Take"" where he gives his opinion of the article and expands on it. There are even several episodes where he simply discusses a topic. He also does interviews with prominent bitcoiners. There are hundreds of episodes to listen too and you don't have to listen in any particular order.

I own some and hope to own more in the future. But, I want to do a thought experiment.

There are many criticisms against Bitcoin and I wanted to go through some of them to see how well we’ve actually thought out positions out.

1. Bitcoin has no use: This is my biggest problem with Bitcoin. Where does its value come from? Even with paper cash, you can burn it to keep yourself warm. But if Bitcoin collapses, what are you actually left with? What is the tangible thing that Bitcoin gives that no other currency can?

2. Governments could ban it: Let’s take this to its logical conclusion. If governments were to outright ban Bitcoin, what would be the point of it? People trade it for goods and they’re left with a load of Bitcoin. But, again, what can they do with that? Other than trade it for something else? And that’s if somebody actually WANTS bitcoin. After all, if it’s banned, there’s very little Bitcoin could be other than a token which people shift around.

3. It’s too volatile: This is a problem I can’t reconcile. Until stability occurs, how can anyone realistically price anything? And if people can’t price goods in Bitcoin, the concept of it being an alternative currency goes out of the window. Whoever heard of a currency that can’t perform as a currency?!

4. It’s too deflationary: Ultimately there can only be 21 quadrillion Satoshis available (if I’ve done my maths correctly!), which means if Bitcoin gets to a certain price point, people may not be able to use Bitcoin because even a Satoshi would be too expensive. And given we want mass adoption would there even be enough Satoshis for a functioning economy to work?

So, can you address these objections? I like thought experiments like this because my day job is science and part of science is falsification and validation. This is what I am trying to achieve here.

We defined smart contracts and covered the functionality of the Taproot-enabled ones. To summarize, Taproot gives new characteristics to Bitcoin layer one that enable smart contract expressiveness in layer two solutions. Today, the topic is privacy. What happens on the blockchain stays there forever. With that in mind, these Taproot contracts only reveal absolutely necessary information.  In the past, to execute a contract, each and every node of the Bitcoin network had to run it. That left the parties involved in the contract vulnerable and exposed, as Bitcoin Magazine explains. For the Bitcoin network to prosper the developers have to think of every scenario, and this is one. The Taproot upgrade fixes this. Blockstream gives us a slightly more technical explanation, “The innovation of Taproot is to embed the scripting capability, which previously had to be conspicuously opted into by wallet software (for example, to support escrow payments, Lightning HTLCs or multisignature policies), inside the key itself.” This is one of the innovations that’ll help future wallets to function in a lighter and more effective way. Bitcoinist will cover that topic later on. For now, Blockstream informs us that after Taproot. It’s also worth noting that, post-Taproot, it won’t be possible to identify the nature of most transactions. All of them will look the same on the blockchain. Unfortunately, a Reddit user already figured out a way to identify the opening of public Lightning Network channels. In any case, there’ll be more privacy all around the Bitcoin network.

I do not believe in the long run this could work. 

The shorting of bitcoin through selling of cash settled futures contracts only works through the arbitrage created between the spot market and the futures markets. 

Any entity with a long term view on bitcoin could use this arbitrage to progressively buy greater amounts of bitcoin for the lower prices.

This would end up further restricting supply and eventually increasing prices.

The more the price is suppressed the more shorting is required to keep it down. This would end up being another way that printed money would enter the economy, which would add to inflation and increase the value of bitcoin relative to the money supply.

I was able to meet directly some people from platforms like Binance or [Mexo.io](https://Mexo.io) or people from Trezor, the hardware wallet company, so I was able to ask them some questions I had, talk to them and chill. Also I met some early bitcoin adopters who were from like from 2012 and so and I took some friends and showed them to listen to the experience of these people. It felt nice to be in an environment where everyone knew about this and was inspiring to continue and plan and to more things with it. There were other artists like me who were painting surf tables that were later auctioned and the money will be sent to help one of our hospitals, it was like $11k in USD. Also I was able to talk to some legislators who were responsible to make the bitcoin law a reality and they were there like everyone else, enjoying the moment and learning more and more about bitcoin. I talked to them about more opportunities we can have with this technology.   


Some of my friends who were skeptical about bitcoin were saying that it looks good and some other were able to see the potential that it has to bring investment and more money to the country to be able to develop it and do more things.   


There were foreigners all over the place and I saw even people who opposed to bitcoin to comment that it is good to have so many US people coming (tho there were visitors from Europe and Asia also). 

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody or just very few people believe the bitcoin detractors here. I saw some ads in social networks from them saying that it is not real money, but the people in the comments were basically just telling them to go off to tell those lies to another place. Most people say ""I don't understand it yet but it looks good"". Others don't use it but don't oppose to it. I think that changes here are being slowly but fast at the same time. The event organizers met here just like a month ago and back then we had some investors coming, but now they are more and they are interacting more with the Salvadoran public. Also some of them are going to the radio stations, TV networks and showing in social media. What I have seen is that more and more young people is joining the cripto sphere here, they are more into NFT games also, and virtual lands. I myself am becoming a designer for videogames paid in BTC. I talked about it with some of the legislators at the event because I wanted them to be aware of that opportunity also, they also talked about DeFi, and even the ambassador was there and talked about Bitcoin, remittances, investment, videogames, virtual reallity and more stuff.

I mean technically i only sold the amount i put in and didnt gain anything..I think thats fair. But the IRS isnt fair. Im totally ignorant in regard of crytpo taxes. Can someone privy give me advice short of paying a crytpo tax expert.

Part 2

I have been VERY bullish that bitcoin will get close to 100k or better around the end of the year or early 2022.. My plan from the start was to DCA as much as I could afford, then take out my initial investment of BTC (anywhere above 90k)  then continue to hold and continue to DCA for the long haul. Leaving me with 40k-ish left

If bitcoin hits 100k, should i take out more than 30k and wait for the huge correction to start buying back in? Opposed to risking a possible 85 percent correction that most respected BTC pundits predict? When or if the crytpo winter starts?

I heard these guys talking about how BTC’s price could double or triple overnight if $100 billion came in from some hedge funds for example. 

I get that market cap is the price multiplied by number of shares. But, my question is how could $100 billion worth of investments add $1 trillion to $2 trillion to the market cap? 

For some reason I always thought if someone bought $10k worth of a stock, the market cap increased $10k (which I know doesn’t make sense now because there’s not enough in circulation to justify the market cap prices we see in all these companies/cryptos.)

The state of this subreddit is becoming more and more alarming and it is not because of price actions. It is natural to be hopeful and want the price action to be positive, but these days the constant circle of confirmation bias everywhere makes this place especially feel more like a cult.

The main reason I am writing this is because of the recent Hillary Clinton interview / opinion on the topic of cryptocurrencies as a whole. While reading the comments for those specific posts, there was a constant cycle of hatred against these 'old politicians' and institutions, which gave people more fuel to double down on their investments/ideology. Adding to this - No one really addressed what her claim really means!? Most people for some reason see this as a positive piece of news. 

If governments or bigger institutions in general at one point in the future realize that decentralized cryptocurrencies put their sovereign control over people / money at risk, do we actually think that they will not take all the measures available to them to stop that from happening? Yes, crypto becoming more mainstream as a whole makes it harder and harder to stop it completely - but this does not mean that they will not decide to do it. Take China as an example, because of the structure of their government they take a longer outlook on the future, which also allows them to see threats coming their way a little bit earlier than western nations - thus they are trying to mitigate this risk much as possible. Western nations will eventually catch up.. There is a world, where all of this ends very poorly for most of us here.

I am pro crypto, but I personally think that the real test for crypto will happen once countries wake up to the issue and actually try to do something. It is also possible that it may not happen, but it is irrational to disregard these negative scenarios. As one of the largest cryptocurrency communities on reddit we should try to inform ourselves and especially new retail investors of the risks inherent within this technology/investment. It will definitely gonna be a bumpy ride and engaging in constructive discussion will only be beneficial for everyone.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban sees the intrinsic value of DAOs. “The future of corporations could be very different as DAOs take on legacy businesses,” he tweeted in May. “Entrepreneurs that enable DAOs can make money. If the community excels at governance, everyone shares in the upside.”
The Problem
DAO, the word is thrown around left right and center without actually truly extracting the essence and justifying it to the contributors. There’s a lot of DAOs out there, which is kind of a secret society that are closed groups consisting of KOLs and Influencers who get in early. They put a barrier by making newcomers holding specific numbers of tokens or a reserved price to enter. Keeping people like us out of reach, the entry to the club is reserved only for elites and business moguls with huge stacks of cash. We are on the sideline and there’s no true DAO that exists which gives rights to all individuals without that huge barrier to enter.
Solutions
What is a DAO?
A distributed autonomous organization (DAO) is for people to coordinate funding, labor, time and social capital. The governance of DAOs is distributed, with all funds and assets managed on-chain via smart contracts. There’s no board of directors, nor is there central control of the organization. They coordinate components of the soft human-facing layer of crypto: money, social capital, reputation and attention. They give power to individuals upon crowd consensus, and are inherently a political tool.
DAOs are decentralized, which means they aren’t governed by one person or entity. The rules and governance of each DAO is coded in smart contracts on the blockchain and cannot be changed unless voted upon by the DAO’s members.
What is KratosDAO bringing to the table?
KratosDAO stands on the shoulders of giants and finds itself honored to be part of the contributing frontier of Web 3.0. But that is just the beginning.
it is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse, much like the rustic who wanted to know where he was going to die so that he’d never go there. Indeed, many problems can’t be solved forward. And that is why the great algebraist, Carl Jacobi, so often said: “invert, always invert.” And why Pythagoras thought in reverse to prove that the square root of two was an irrational number. — Charlie Munger
OlympusDAO has accumulated a huge reserve in their treasury. What if we use a portion (10 or 20% — decided by the DAO) of the stablecoins that’s in the treasury and make a better use of it by investing in Seed/Private rounds via the DAO community? We can maximize the ROI by investing in vetted projects by our DAO members.
The most important aspect of KratosDAO is transparency. Every decision within the DAO is pitched, discussed, voted on and documented publicly.
For too long the value that communities create online has been captured by platforms, not people. We believe web 3 and social tokens invert this old dynamic and return ownership to creators and their communities.
Tokens give communities super powers. Today, groups of people using accessible, on-chain tools can leverage tokens to capitalize, reward, govern and grow collective value on the internet.
While it’s never been easier to issue a community token, the path to developing one with lasting utility and influence requires a holistic approach spanning governance, tokenomics, incentives and community organization.
KratosDAO brings community leaders, brands, investors and builders together to solve these complex problems and bring the best community tokens to market. When a group of like-minded individuals come together, they can achieve success that cannot be rivalled.

Hey guys, just a quick question regarding long-term capital gains taxes for cashing out Bitcoin.

I'm planning to DCA into Bitcoin and hold onto it for at least 5-10 years, maybe even more. However, when researching tax implications for cashing out BTC I found out that holding BTC for over a year requires less capital gains taxes paid.

However, if I'm dollar-cost averaging, will each specific purchase need to be held for over a year to avoid short-term capital gains or does that not apply?

For example, if I buy 0.1 BTC right now and hold onto it, buy another 0.1 BTC in three years and cash out the next day, will I have to pay short-term capital gains taxes on the latter purchase or does everything fall under long-term capital gains?

This doesn't seem fully open to me, but I'm happy for these articles to be proven wrong. 

[source 1](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/03/taproot-update-bitcoin-users-home-in-on-activation-plan-date-still-tbd/): 

""Many of Bitcoin’s most active stakeholders have just about nailed down the activation method for Taproot, the Bitcoin software’s biggest upgrade in years.

In a public meeting on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) Tuesday, Bitcoin developers, miners, business professionals and enthusiasts hashed out the specifics of how to package the Taproot upgrade into an update – and how to activate it once the code has been shipped.

The most active of the 200 or so participants on the chat (mostly, but not all, developers) seemed to agree on the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would be used to activate Taproot. To prep the BIP for shipment, they also voted to “merge” two “pull requests” (PRs) on GitHub that outline the rules for Taproot’s activation logic into Bitcoin’s source code when the time comes to push the upgrade.""

[source 2](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-taproot-proposed-bitcoin-upgrade):

""Community members, in public meetings, ultimately decided on a proposal for adoption called ""Speedy Trial,"" which gave a three-month period for miners to signal with a 90% threshold needed for activation.""

Should this be rephrased as 'key community members""? 

[source 3](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/09/crypto-long-short-why-bitcoins-taproot-upgrade-matters/):

""Also, because there is no central body to decide on Bitcoin upgrades, they need to be agreed upon by all the key stakeholders. Consensus is always extremely difficult to achieve.""

Is this not open enough for decentralisation if a few key players are deciding on what upgrades should take place?

Here are 3 reasons why Bitcoin will reach $100k by mid-2022

1. Bitcoin is no longer a solution without a problem. 
The first Bitcoin ETF was launched by Proshares. We expect to see the new futures ETF funds from VanEck, Galaxy Digital, Invesco and Valkyrie as well. El Salvador has recently made the Bitcoin a legal tender and more than 80% of central banks are actively engaging with digital currencies.

Zuck’s meta verse will also be a big driver of this growth. NFTs which are already soaring in price will see more surge as development speeds up.


2. Almost of Bitcoin has been mined.
So far, approximately 18.4million Bitcoins out of a total of 21 million have been mined. Between 10-30% are out of market due to lost password and and the likes.

From an economic perspective, the upcoming halvenings and eventual end of rewards will see miner only incentivized for their effort with transaction fees. And as we expect, with reduced supply and increased demand comes a surge in price.

To top this off, in the first half of 2021 Visa had more than $1billion flow through their crypto-linked cards. We expect a Bitcoin-linked card from MasterCard by late next year. This will drive up retail and consumer transactions.

3. Crypto is approaching its tipping point

No, crypto hasn’t reached its tipping point yet. By early 2022 it will get close as financial systems by government continues to weaken and the current bubble we’re in burst.

Strange request, but figured someone here may have some thoughts on this:  

I have a basic understanding of code (very basic), but still an interest in it.  I know bitcoin is over 100k lines of C++, but would love to learn more about how it functions on a mechanical level. There are tons of videos on youtube describing how btc works, but they are really more broad-based animations of what blockchain is and the ideas behind bitcoin.  That's NOT what i'm looking for.  

Much more interested in doing a deep dive on how the bitcoin system is programmed and how the constituent parts all fit together.  It would be cool to hear someone fluent in C++, and also someone who understands bitcoin, talk about the unique functions and what makes it  ""the most sound, secure, and decentralized"" money ever invented.  Technical = good.

Do you know of any videos that do a code breakdown of how it works?  (Ideally, a couple hours of a programmer showing and discussing the framework.)

I just feel like if this thing is intended to revert it back to fiat to make purchases and ""get rich"" off of fiat then somehow we have distorted Satoshi's vision. Maybe we shouldn't be looking at it like some ""store of value"" because what value are we placing it on? Fiat?

Everyone is planning to sell 100k+ with the expectation of the price crashing back to 20k. 

I think the public consensus on Bitcoin's future price is wrong.

 The four year cycle is likely a thing of the past for two reasons: 

1. Supply side: The Bitcoin supply will only ever inflate 10% for the rest it's life, meaning the halvenings will no longer cause a severe supply shock like it once did.  For all practical purposes,    
we can forget about supply from mining and get in the mindset that Bitcoin has already hit its supply limit of 21m coins.
2. Demand side: The % growth of users going from a few dozen users to hundreds of millions of users was massive. There are only 8 billion people on Earth, so the % growth of users will decline as we hit the Law of Large Numbers.

Their reason to Ban cryptocurrency are:-

1. ""To safeguard the interest of Indian Youths""...

Seriously!? Then why not ban gambling sites like Dream11, and Rummy. Also the same youths were standing in queues during Lockdown at the Wine Shop. Why don't you ban those stores. You won't because they gave you huge taxes and VAT.

2. ""It is a quick rich scheme with huge risk""....

Isn't that the reason why we invest. Why do we invest if we can't have profit. What's the purpose of Investment then. And also, We are investing our own hard earned money, not like the government is giving it for charity, then What's the problem why can't we spend our money, the way we want.

3. ""We can't track and control them, So we'll introduce our own digital money""

The purpose of Cryptocurrency is Freedom from Government and Financial Institution, So that no one can access our funds than us. If we have to use Government Coins then what's the purpose of Decentralisation and Privacy. Banks can easily block our Bank Accounts anytime, We won't have access to our money then.

4. ""It could fund Terrorism""

Surely it can!! But wait!?! What about Paper Money?? Are they fully safe. Infact, Terrorists also have Bank Account access. Why can't you trace them even now??

Some great extend of Idiosyncrasy is seen here. Why some Old, Non-Tech peoples who don't even know what Cryptocurrency is got to decide, What the Youths of India should do!?

The Only Reason why the Government is against Cryptocurrency is because they don't want us to be Financially free or else their Note Printing Inflation scam won't work and also because we won't be paying them taxes and bank fees then.

I know there is a button to set a price to buy at a certain price and sell at a certain price.

So with Robinhood does a buy and sell ""settle"" automatically for Bitcoin or does it take 2 days? I don't know what account I have on Robinhood but I sold a stock for a pretty high price because it was at an all time high I thought it might drop the next day (today) and I was right it dropped like 5 percent... But I didn't know it would take 2 days for those funds to settle... I think the when you sold you can use that money instantly...?

Does Bitcoin follow the same path or because it can be traded 24/7 are the fund settled instantly?

I had 1 whole BTC (welcome to my DM, scammers). This is a lot of money for me, with my salary of $720/month.

I have always believed that I am quite tech-savvy and have computer skills above the regular user. I was especially interested in security. I loved to climb in the settings, turn on all the security options EVERYWHERE, on the PC and phone - in all programs and applications.

My computer was no exception, which at first was my working PC and then migrated to the basement, got a couple of cards and began to mine ETH.

It all started that I downloaded a new version of the miner from a phishing site that was in the top in Google at my request.

The miner mined as it should, but on the first launch, he injected an exploit into my PC (Windows 10) that gave an attacker access to Googgle Remote Desktop. And this is access to everything. This alone gave the hacker access to my entire electronic life. My Google account, passwords in Chrome. I EVEN MADE A QR RECOVERY SCREENSHOT OF Google Autenteficator AND IT SYNCHRONIZED WITH Google Photos.

At 1 am I received two e-mails about the successful entry into my accounts in Binance and another local exchange in my country. But I have zeros in my accounts.

My bitcoin was on my electrum, which was installed on the same PC. The only thing that saved me was that I put a password on my seed. BUT THIS PASSWORD WAS AMONG THE SAVED ON GOOGLE CHROME.

An elementary substitution of each password from Chrome into electrum would give access to all my funds sooner or later.

I must say that I did not immediately understand what was the matter. I reinstalled Windows but ran the same miner again, and everything was repeated. The problem was that the memory was clogged and I was losing the hashrate and I was looking for a problem in this.

Once again, when I was sitting at the computer, I saw a standard notification by Chrome Remote YOUR COMPUTER IS CONTROLLED by [username@gmail.com](mailto:username@gmail.com) (this was my personal account). I understood everything. I instantly transferred all my money via phone to another address in Samourai Wallet.

And the next day I was already unpacking my new Trezor.

I must say that I was quite negative about hardware wallets, thinking that I had enough skills to secure myself on my PC or phone.

Now I advise everyone to have a hardware wallet.

Or crypto in general for that matter? To quote Peter Hillmann, Marcus Knüpfer, Erik Heiland and Andreas Karcher:

""The constantly growing size of blockchains becomes a challenge with the increasing usage. Especially the storage of unwanted data in a blockchain is an issue, because it cannot be removed naturally. In order to counteract this problem, we present the first concept for the selective deletion of single entries in a blockchain. For this purpose, the general consensus algorithm is extended by the functionality of regularly creating summary blocks. Previous data of the chain are summarized and stored again in a new block, leaving out unwanted information. With a shifting marker of the Genesis Block, data can be deleted from the beginning of a blockchain. In this way, the technology of the blockchain becomes fully transactional. The concept is independent of a specific block structure, network structure, or consensus algorithm. Moreover, this functionality can be adapted to current blockchains to solve multiple problems related to scalability.""",3510241,Selective Deletion in Blockchain (Question),0,1.0,2021-11-04 10:22:09,NEGATIVE,0.9997723698616028

Mitigating centralization, high fees, and single points of failure mean staying ahead of the curve in this game.

Network of Momentum is a fast, feeless, and censorship-resistant network aiming to supersede Solana or Ethereum by solving scalability, usage cost, fairness of the initial distribution, and decentralization. With a radically new DLT that combines PoW &amp; PoS, they introduced:

* Unprecedented dual ledger (Meta-DAG + Block-Lattice) architecture to ensure the protocol scalability
* Two types of nodes (Pillars, Sentinels) for consensus
* PoW-Links with potential Bitcoin interoperability for power processing &amp; security
* Foundation for mass-scalable zApps controlled by smart contracts
* ZTS (Zenon token standard) allows anyone to create native tokens without a single line of code
* Plasma (an anti-spam mechanism that acts as the network gas to confer no fees at all by staking)

Coin Economics &amp; Participation:

NoM also introduces a dual-coin approach with ZNN and QSR as primary assets, each with its own purpose. ZNN is used as collateral for network consensus to ensure transactions validity on-chain, while QSR is used as collateral for nodes and to fuse Plasma to submit transactions and influence how fast they are being validated by node operators.

There are three ways to participate in the network as an infrastructure provider:

1. by running a Pillar node (15’000 ZNN) - 80% APY
2. by running a Sentinel node (5’000 ZNN) - 60% APY
3. by delegating or staking ZNN (1 ZNN or more) - +24% APY

I just put in my two weeks notice at my current job. I don't necessarily hate this position, and the people I work with are great, but it'd be an understatement to say that I became very complacent, and stagnant as the years went on here.

Well, several months from my first purchase of Bitcoin, I will be starting my first position in the cryptocurrency industry!

This is just the first, and I am beyond ecstatic to have the opportunity to help usher in a new age of economic freedom to the world.

I'm stoked! And want to thank you all for being so supportive, and willing to help others learn and get on board the Bitcoin and crypto train!

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”  - Satoshi Nakamoto

Bitcoin was created as a response to the egregious mishandling of fiat currency by governments.  If it had not been for the designed oppression of the citizens by the central banks and government agencies, there would have never been any need for Bitcoin.  Rather than provide an honest currency, our “leaders” (all of our leaders through the entire world) used fiat to steal from their citizens and enrich their cronies by engaging in debasement of our currencies.

On April 5th 1933, executive order 6102 was signed by FDR and initiated the widespread confiscation of gold from American citizens. In 1971, Nixon ended the gold standard as a temporary measure.  These acts completely destroyed our currency and the promise the government had made to the people.  You were no longer allowed to own gold or even own money backed by gold.  Satoshi’s birthday is April 5th because that is when it became illegal to own gold and his birth year is 1975 because that was the year when it became legal to own gold again. I believe Satoshi chose this birthday because he wanted to highlight the corrupt nature of government’s involvement with currency.  Of course, “Satoshi” is a fictitious character created by Bitcoins creator. 

Cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin, will destroy governments as we know it.  It’s just a matter of time.  This is because goverment will no longer have the ability to control the currency, rack up debts, and bail out their failed cronies by devaluing all of our hard work and ingenuity.  After all, inflation is when the government counterfeits money to syphon away your wealth like a parasite.

Reporting our transactions to the IRS is a temporary measure.  Relatively soon, with the implementation of hidden wallets and widespread acceptance of crypto, there will be no way for a 3rd party to track funds and no need for a fiat exchange.  Any reporting of transactions or sales taxation will be impossible.  There will be absolutely no way for the government to effectively tax the citizens or print money out of thin air.  All their power will be gone.  

“Bitcoin was designed to do one thing, destroy central banks.” - Max Keiser 

Regardless of how you feel about taxation and government, it will need to radically change as crypto grows.  The currency system will die and a new era will emerge where the people are in control of the money.  Now that the money has been fixed, the government will soon actually bend to the will of people be forced to fix itself or be replaced.

Newbies are confused why this elicits so much frustration, and I suspect longtime hodlers may not even know why all this bothers them so much. Given that, I wanted to set forth what I see as the Bitcoin ideals are and how it reshapes your worldview. 

There are two ideals of the Bitcoin ethos. Those are: decentralization and strong time preference. You can arrive at these ideals indepdendent of Bitcoin, of course. And if you have ever wondered by Bitcoiners hold in high regard the opinions of those who are strongly anti-Bitcoin, such as Warren Buffet of Peter Schiff, it's because these people how some of the Bitcoin ideals without accepting the underlying protocol of Bitcoin. I will briefly discuss the two ideals and how those ideals change your worldview.

&amp;#x200B;

**Decentralization** \- here is a unspoke truth that many understand but few can express. No one has a clue what is going on or what they are doing. Humans are irrational. Even people who realize this, are they themselves irrational. We operate on the basis of many things, including emotions and our subconsious. We may act in a way and be unable to explain why we are acting in that way. We are pathological. We are subject to biases. We cannot fully comprehend or adequately observe things in the world, particularly numbers and time. At the end of the day, we are finite creatures with brains that have limited capacity and shortcomings. 

Behavioral economist have done multiple studies showing how poorly we make decisions, particularly economic decisions. There is plenty litretature out there showing how apparently stupid people are. Now here is the secret no one wants you to admit. This applies just the same to you, the homeless man on the street, and even the CEO of a billion dollar corporation, or a chairman of the federal reserve, or the President of the United States. None of these people, despite what they may have you think, has a clue what is going on at any given moment, much less can the design a society or an economy, and the certainly cannot predict the future. No single person can. No single person can single handedly make something in our economy. As a famous example, take the ""story of the pencil."" You will find numerous youtube videos explaining this story. In sum, no single person can create a pencil. Instead, a single pencil is the product of innumerable economic connections that span the globe. No single person plans these connections, and indeed, no single person *could* plan these connections. They, instead, spontaneously occur. 

While a single person is irrational, multiple people acting out of pure economic incentives are rational. Society and the economy will naturally coordinate to optimal outcomes without the need of a designer. There is, moreover, a certain wisdom in crowds. For example, a famous experiment was done in which people were asked to guess the weight of a bull at a fair. I beleive none of the guesses were spot on. There were people who were close, of course. But there were also people who were widely off by a lot. But here is the remakrable part. When the guesses were averaged, the average number was either exactly correct or off by only a few pounds. 

So, what is the conclusion you should draw from this? When someone asks about swing trading, they are presumming they are smarter than the crowd. They beleive that they can guess the price of something and be more correct than the collective wisdom of the marketplace. That's simply not true, and the fact a person thinks otherwise only demonstrates how unaware of their own shortcomings they are. Most traders in the high 90% lose money on average. Those who don't likely only got lucky. So from an investing stand point, it's important to reduce the number of choices you need to make. In the best case scenario, your average will be equal to the market and the collective decisiosn of others. The worst case scenario, you underperform. That is why Warren Buffet, for example, said the market ""is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.” The chances that you bought the right investment at the right time and for the right amount is nearly zero. But if all you need to do is buy the right investment, time will take care of the rest. 

What does the decentralization revalation reveal for policy making? Well institutions and their leaders are as clueless as the rest of us. The idea that they could supplement their ""knowledge"" for that of the market is ignorant at best, and dangerous at worst. But they don't see it that way. Indeed, they tinker with our lives and our economy in order to ""improve it."" The fed runs the money printer as a solution to every problem. Housing bubble caused by cheap credit? Solution: more cheap credit. Global pandemic with 1% fatality rate and lockdowns putting people out of work? Solution: print money. There is is not a problem they believe can't be fixed with the money printer. It's silly really. But they would have you believe they are the smartest people in the room? Why? Well they need that illusion becuase without it you won't trust them. But they also beleive they are the smartest people in the room. They were trained at the best colleges, graduated at the top of their classes, and clawed their way to the top of some prestigious instution. They played the game well. But at the end of the day, they are irrational humans like the rest of us. They are subject to biases. They are subject to irrationality. They are subject to political pressures. They are subject to economic pressures. They will fail you. Humans will fail you.

Bitcoin is a decentralized algorithm. It has been ticking along for 12 years. It does not care what the opinions of others are. It does not care if the great majority of the public wants cheap credit. It does not care who is the President of the United States, or if there is even a United States of America. It's an algorithm that contines to operate irrespective of these things. Unlike people, it is predictable. Unlike people, it's not irrational. It is a simple algorithm. That's it. It is supported by the actions of millions of people around the globe who, acting out of self-interest, support and protect its algorithm. It has a fixed supply that cannot be altered without near unanimous approval. In a world of excess and irrational people, it is a solid rock. So when someone asks when should I exit out of Bitcoin, you know they don't get it.

**Strong time preference** \- Anything worth doing does not come easily or fast. In a fiat world, your money melts away. Although this is not percievable over a short term basis, it is baked into your mind and you behaviors and those of your parents, and their parents before them. You are incentivized to spend money as quickly as possible. Business are incentivized to cash on in the next cheap junk to the lowest common denominator to make a quick buck that's melting away. They have to stay above the rate of inflation and grow. It sometimes feels like no one is building for the future anymore. Strong assets that are liquid, such as Bitcoin, can change this behavior. It will incentivize people to save. It will incentivize people to hold. It will incentivize them to be patient, and not to buy junk or seek fleeting pleasures. For the first time in a long time, Bitcoin gives people the ability to think long term and plan ahead, not only a decade but for generations. I will be able to give my Bitcoin to my grandchildren. The network will exist in 100 years from now. It will exist 1000 years from now. Bitcoin will never be worth zero. In fact, more people are going to demand it as time goes on. More people are going to trust Bitcoin as time goes on.

Quote: “And once these spot ETFs roll, I think you’ll see billions, then tens of billions, then hundreds of billions, then trillions of dollars flow into them.” - Michael Saylor

Background: A pair of Bitcoin futures ETFs began trading in October. Bitcoin futures is a derivative product. A spot Bitcoin ETF tracks the actual price of Bitcoin. It allows investors to get exposure to the asset without actually owning it.

What the Expert Says: Saylor said on Thursday that Bitcoin futures are “inferior.”

Final Thoughts: A spot Bitcoin ETF probably won’t get approved by The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission until 2022.

Otherwise, exchanges will just become the Web3's centralized answer to Web 2.0 and long-term investors will be vulnerable to that.

Long sorry: 

I hope the title didn’t turn everyone off since people love a profit, but I have a buddy who is a no-coiner.  He is running a non-profit to help fund schools in a certain war torn country.

He is currently having problems getting money to the entities running the schools bc of banking issues and western union being shut down.

I have mentioned casually in the past that he should maybe look into Bitcoin as a possible means to increase safety and decrease costs of moving the money.  He recently asked me about it in the context of legality. I know some about the crypto side and can help him with logistics, but am not a legal expert on dealing with AML situations and cross-border money movement.

You shouldn't feel bad for taking profits if your game is to accumulate more fiat. Just remember that you now have fiat and not sound money like BTC or gold. Fiat will increasingly come under pressure in the next decade. I found it to be a relief to be part of a new Bitcoin standard and not see it as a game or a casino to get more dollars. What I would do is put some of your ""profits"" in BTC (and maybe some gold) and don't look at the fiat price. Just keep it there for the next decade(s). I know from experience that this is more difficult than it sounds. I've seen a minus 85% in my BTC in 2018 and I'm mentally preparing myself for another big downturn. I have been freaking out a little less every time it happens, till I honestly don't care that much anymore for monthly fluctuations. I see it finally as part of the process towards a new monetary system. Learn to be a Stoic around volatility.

Hello World!! Thanks for supporting My First Bitcoin El Salvador! 

As you may know, El Salvador its the first country in the world that adopted #Bitcoin as its currency! We are so excited for this and we will like to share this project to you guys! 

We are an International [\#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 education project.   We are dedicated to facilitating adoption in El Salvador by fostering a thriving Bitcoin community that everyday is getting bigger.   

 Our mission is to boost [\#Bitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hashtag_click)📷 towards decentralization, self-sovereignty and personal responsibility.  The classes in My First Bitcoin do not require any advanced knowledge and will be based on the use of technology and personally connecting students with what you can do. 

We are at the beginning of a new way of interacting with power. Bitcoin will change the world, but exactly how that change manifests itself is still uncertain. Our vision is of a world where people have more power over their own lives, where innovation doesn't need permission, censorship is difficult, and money is separate from the state or other centralized institutions. We want to push Bitcoin towards decentralization, self-sovereignty and personal responsibility, which is its home state. Our goal is to empower students to take their first step towards using Bitcoin. We want to lead by example. To show rather than tell. To make the intangible real.

Check our website! : [https://myfirstbitcoin.io/](https://myfirstbitcoin.io/)

We will be so helpfull if you guys can Donate to this cause: bc1q5n3kup3fzh7w8y6xc3g7q2lvaz3xujz6kvk0gct08yggawazqszsnlwwwm

My interest in BTC was, sadly, due to anything but “the tech.” At age 25, as I was preparing to exchange my remaining BTC for something that would allow me to disconnect from reality, I got the phone call: my older brother had died unexpectedly. 

My brother Max, among the most kind and caring people I have even known, suffered a psychotic break in his late 20s, and our mental healthcare system - or lack there of - completely failed him.

He has left separate notes for each of us, which my mother read to me. Mine was two sentences: “I love you, nomjs. Live purposefully and with abandon; do not succumb to the temptation of a thin life; you are capable of great things.”

I did chuckle through the anguish that someone who just committed suicide (and abuses semicolons) had provided the ultimate example of “do as I say,  not as I do.”

But nonetheless, these final words - for some reason I honestly can’t explain - led me to bitcointalk.org. Maybe it was the first place my brain thought of to find meaning because I was in the middle of a transaction? I had perused it once before, but found the more passionate posts about the ills of central banking and the promise of digital hard money to be more fanciful than anything. 

And then I went way back to read Satoshi, Finney, and co. These men were not leading a thin life - they embarked on what must have felt like a quixotic quest to change our money because it was the right thing to do. Period.

Details: The data from the report points to a potential supply shock where long-term holders are not taking profits. The number of bitcoins that haven’t moved in the past 6 months has already reached a 3-year low, according to the report.

Big Picture: Basically, the report finds a lot of strength among long-term holders and mining pools. This includes individual miners who have realized modest profits.

Numbers: The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over 35% in October.

Final Thoughts: Despite these trends, the report concludes that there is a considerably healthy macro environment for Bitcoin.

I'm currently starting my research called ''What effect did covid have on individual cryptocurrency investors aged 19-25?''. In my hopes to best formulate my research questions, I would like you to tell me in the comments how did your investment behaviours change during the covid pandemic. It can be something simple, like 'I became more bold with my moves' or 'I had more time to research coins because I was staying at home, so I could do more informed choices'. Let me know if you invested in any smaller coins, looked into getting in debt to invest in crypto. This is your time to shine and I need to know what you did!

I will make sure to come back here to post my updates on the research.

Are there any risks here I need to be aware of? Once the btc hits my wallet, is it possible for the buyer to reverse the transaction?

I have been aiming to better understand Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general over the last couple of weeks. I recently invested in some crypto however I actively chose not to buy any BTC because there are a number of concerns I have regarding the platform. Specifically in the longevity of the network. I'm hoping to have some new perspectives on these thoughts from the community here so I can get in on this as a well informed investor.

1. Block Subsidies - At time of writing the BTC block reward sits at 6.25 BTC/block. As the BTC reward continues to approach 0 miners will have to rely on transaction fees in order to keep their machines running. My assumption is that miners are 100% economically motivated which leads to my concern of the network being abandoned to mine more profitable coins. If in general a miner will always follow the money will the network fail. I understand that as less computing power becomes available fees increase and therefore it becomes more economical to stay on the network but at some point won't the network become unsustainable or too volatile to be worthwhile.
2. Introduction of Quantum - This applies to all crypto currencies but if quantum computers are realised not only will it be possible to hash at rates beyond any GPUs but it also opens up the blockchain to quantum malicious attacks. Is there something I'm missing on the technical implementation that protects from this or are quantum computers able to undermine the network as described.
3. Platform is Only Self Sustaining - Bitcoin exists only to sustain itself. Other currencies are a consequence of a decentralized network as a service platform and therefore they not only are self sustaining but relied on by other platforms. This indicates to me that there are more incentives to use these networks and transaction/gas fees seem much more economical because they encompass any number of decentralized functions. From my perspective BTC seems outdated but I do understand the value in just simply doing one thing well
4. Environmental Concerns - This goes for most crypto currencies as well but the mining and network management has requires mass amounts of electricity. With most of the world still burning fossil fuels this doesn't sit great for me. I don't really have a solution for this other than the fact that I choose not to purchase a mining rig myself.

Would really appreciate some perspectives on these points so I can make an informed decision.

Hi all,

I've written my first article on Lightning and I must say it's not really for this group... :)

I break all the rules in terms of ""not your keys, not your coins"", I don't cover any of the fundamental principles/philosophy of bitcoin, or security or even provide a variety of options of ""better platforms"" to on-board with.

It's really not anything new in the grand scheme of things, but what I've done is try to create a single resource that offers a complete and straightforward way for someone you may know who needs that little push to take the next step to get some practical experience with Bitcoin and Lightning.

So if you read it and think it’s any good, please consider sharing.

Anyway, here it is - [Bitcoin Shopping Discounts with Lightning Payment](https://hasoforsoundmoney.com/lightningpayments/) \- as well as some further context below. Happy to receive feedback and would be great to know if it is actually helpful..

The “Bitcoin-as-a-means-for-payment” sceptic - For potential new users who are cautious, curious but want to learn by doing. They may be looking for a single resource or guide they can follow for a hands-on experience with Bitcoin and making a Lightning payment.

Shoppers – Who may be looking for different avenues for discounts/bargains and don’t mind doing something new and following a few steps to get them.

**What is it?**

Its effectively a short course – (about 30mins on average), taking the reader (who may have little to no knowledge of Bitcoin) through the process of converting dollars to Bitcoin and then make a Lightning payment. No additional resources needed.

**Why?**

The incentive is by learning this method of payment, new markets and opportunities become available for discounts and/or better value-for-money purchases.

**Longer Term Effects**

The reader, in becoming familiar with the utility of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network may, over time, transition to also viewing Bitcoin as a store of value and therefore hodl some allocation.",3500141,Bitcoin Shopping Discounts with Lightning Payments (A practical guide you might like to share with your friends/family),0,1.0,2021-11-01 22:54:40,POSITIVE,0.7959027290344238

Hello. I am trying to learn about consensus mechanisms and how they work, starting with PoW in the bitcoin blockchain. Can someone please help explain this to me with layman's terms, and with non tech analogies if possible? What I am getting confused about with PoW is that I am reading that in a blockchain there are thousands of nodes competing to solve a mathematical problem, and the winner is the one who gets to verify the most recent block of the blockchain.

Firstly, I thought the one of the big ideas behind blockchain is that it's not just one computer or one organization verifying the accuracy of a ledger, and that it is instead thousands or millions of nodes all of which need to be an agreement as to the accuracy of the latest block in the ledger before verifying it. This is inconsistent with a single ""winner"" being the one to verify a ledger.

Also, what is this ""mathematical"" problem that all the nodes are trying to solve? Is it in anyway related to the transactions on the blockchain themselves? I heard once that the nodes are trying to find a new prime number, and, because prime numbers get rarer and rarer as you go higher up, the harder it becomes for computers to find them. The individual who told me this also told me that each bitcoin represents a prime number, and that's why bitcoins are scarce- because prime numbers, while infinite, become exponentially harder to find as you go higher up.

I consider myself a long-term investor for all the technical, idealistic &amp; financial reasons that many of you are probably sharing as well. But I worry about too much enthusiasm around the future potential price appreciation nowadays. I’d like to discuss one contextual, temporary but none the less historic and massive event that will happen soon and that could put some downward pressure on the spot price.  

For those of you who’ve been in this long enough, [MtGox Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) closed transactions 25th feb 2014 following a massive hack and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins lost and has since been followed by a 8 years legal development aiming at returning former customers what could be « saved » (apparently [200k BTC](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/cryptocurrency/news/defunct-bitcoin-exchange-mt-gox-usd-9-billion-2589828)). At the time of the hack, a BTC was around 550USD/coin. Those former customers are now looking at &lt;100x gains.

In October 2021 this rehabilitation plan was approved and the next steps in November will be the [restitution of those bitcoins](http://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20211020_announcement_en.pdf). 

Now, unlike what some may think, the spot price isn’t defined by the market capitalization, but by the depth of the order book and the number of available coins on exchanges. 
[We can see](https://cryptoquant.com/overview/btc-exchange-flows) that a relatively low difference in supply (200k BTC delta between July 20th and now on exchanges) can lead to a huge spot price difference whether appreciation or depreciation (30kUSD/BTC to 60kUSD/BTC).

Now, I feel like if even half (100k BTC) of those MtGox bitcoins are sold by the former customers to secure profits we could see a pretty heavy pressure on price at some point.

I wonder how you folks feel about that and if this makes any sense for you or if I missed something important that would invalidate my take on this situation.

In any case, that is no financial advice, and remember not to ever invest more than what you’ll willing to lose.

Cheers &amp; HODL FTW.",3506082,MtGox restition plan vs BTC price for november,0,1.0,2021-11-03 11:23:48,NEGATIVE,0.9355015754699707

The following situation has developed on the market:

Funding is the most pressing issue for all young teams. It is simply difficult for them to find investors since many of them do not even know where to apply.

In a bank with a loan, they are very likely to be refused, possibly due to insufficient credit history, perhaps there is another reason, and it is not always possible to attract their own funds.

At the same time, there is a huge layer of investors who do not have the largest capital to become a “whale”, however, they are quite capable of financing a developing project if they see the benefit in it.

Coinstox as a Bridge Between Start-ups &amp; Investors

The Coinstox project comes to the aid of startups and investors, which is a link between them, which the blockchain has long lacked. Investors can easily search for startups they like, and startups can grow with their help.

What do startups get?

Investments

Tokenization of their assets and their subsequent sale using the blockchain

Growth through capital raising

Decentralized governance

What do investors get?

Tokenized assets of young companies that buy with cryptocurrency. This makes it easier to acquire them since banks can be bypassed and transactions are instant.

Convenient management of your investment portfolio

P2P token exchange

Smart contracts protect all transactions, which means you can be sure of their reliability and transparency

Thus, Coinstox creates its own ecosystem in which investors can safely invest in companies, receiving start-up tokens in return, which can be sold in the future due to an increase in their price. Moreover, in addition to tokens, each investor receives a special service from companies.

 EFI, as the upgrade of ENJ, has just broken through the current trend, with small market value and extremely low valuation. Once the currency falls below 1 due to a dive, it can be considered in batches. The long-term target is 3U, and the short-term target is 1.5, and stop-profit can be considered

Your private key is a needle in the haystack.  
Well actually that’s not true, your private key is a really big and random number.

So 1st of all why is it a number? Well because everything that’s on a computer is a number.

Ok, but why does it have to be big?

Well, let’s say my private key is a number between 1 and 10. If you want to guess it, you have a 1 in 10 chance of guessing it. Which is pretty bad for me.  
And if you’re a bit zealous it would only take you 10 tries to go through all the possibilities to guess my private key.

Now let’s say my private key is a number between 1 and 115 **quattuorvigintillion**, things are a bit different.  
What is 115 **quattuorvigintillion**?  
That is 2256, and this is the upper limit of the number I was talking about and to put it more into perspective this is how many atoms there are in the visible universe.

So if you would want to go through all the possibilities of all the private keys to guess my private key that would take you about 500 years.  
And that is great because this process is very time-consuming, like finding a needle in the haystack.

So your **private key** is like the needle in the haystack, more precisely the **position of the needle in the haystack**.

If you put your needle at the top of the haystack, anyone can find it.  
If you put it in the corner of the haystack, someone might look there and also find it.  
So if you put in a position that is pretty obvious, someone will guess it with ease. 

But if you would put it in a **random** position, the only way someone could guess the position of your needle(aka your private key) is by going through all the hey in the haystack, which could take a long time.

Luckily you don’t have to worry about this and your wallet takes care of all these things.

# RNGs – Random Number Generators

Your **Bitcoin wallet** is the **instrument** you use **to interact with the Bitcoin network**.  
It has 3 main functions:

1. It generates the private keys
2. It stores the private keys
3. It signs transactions

And depending on what specific wallet you may be using it may include other functionalities.

I’m sure you learned by now from your past relationships that it does not matter how hard you try in the present or even if she’ll do anal once a week if the whole thing had a bad beginning.

The same holds true for cryptography, and more precisely for the security of your Bitcoin keys.  
If your private key was not generated **randomly**\[1\] and **privately**, there is a decent chance you may lose all your coins, and even more, it can nullify future efforts you put into securing your Bitcoin.

The private part is up to you, but the random depends on the software and hardware you trust.  
So what’s so hard?

Well, **computers** are **deterministic machines**, meaning they will do the same thing if you give them the same input.  
Example.  
When I type in xhamster.com in my browser, it takes me to xhamster.com every time\[2\].  
This is great because this is why we use computers in the first place because they are reliable, but this means they are NOT capable of producing random outputs.

Yeah, but cryptography is not only used to secure Bitcoin, in fact, its used all over the place, so clearly we must have solutions that provide use random numbers.

Indeed.  
We have, and they are called Random Number Generators.

Of which there are of 2 types:

1. Pseudo RNGs
2. True RNGs

**PRNGs – Pseudo-Random Number Generators**

https://preview.redd.it/pstv36fnubx71.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ad02da0cbc40a3b1a373b4040f600dfaa20c8de

The Pseudo ones are like fake boobs.  
They may look real for a distance, but on close inspection, it’s obvious they are fake.

These are pretty much an algorithm, a piece of software that spits out multiple numbers.  
These numbers are uniformly distributed, and if you have a few of them you can NOT guess future ones.  
Uniformly distributed means that if you chart them they are all over the place, and dont concentrate in one area.

Remember the needle in the haystack.  
We dont want possible private keys to show any specific patterns or predictability.

&amp;#x200B;

[Numbers from a Pseudo-Random Number Generator plotted.](https://preview.redd.it/tct0ukrsubx71.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94924bd7ad9328387b5eb265e98016cfe48fc9be)

They are useful as they are fast and reliable, and they are used all over the place.  
The operating system on your phone and computer uses them all the time.

So the way these pseudo RNGs work is that they are a function(recursive most of the time) that needs an initial term T0.  
The same way the Fibonacci sequence needs the 1st term.  
Depending on this term you will get different sets of uniformly distributed numbers.

But remember this is a **deterministic process** that runs on a **deterministic machine**, so if someone gets this initial term, they will all be able to generate the same numbers as you, and possibly guess your current and any future private keys you may generate.

Ok, so where do we get this very important 1st term from?

**TRNGs True Random Number Generators**

The answer is True RNGs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ehljcxb0vbx71.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26af5bf0549c51dcadbcb3eae00556575a1cc20a

What makes these ones ""true"" as opposed to ""pseudo"", is the same thing that makes boobs real as opposed to fake.  
The fact that they are natural.

Tru-RNGs are hardware-based and digitize chaotic events from nature in order to produce random numbers.  
They often focus on physical phenomena like atmospheric noise, magnetic noise, or electromagnetic or quantum phenomena like thermal noise or avalanche noise.

The numbers outputted by a TRNG will **also** be uniformly distributed, lack patterns, and are totally unpredictable, but there are 2 differences.  
There is no T0 and there is no algorithm behind them.

If we take 2 data sets one from a PseudoRNG and one from a TrueRNG you can’t distinguish between the two.  
**The only difference is that one is random and one is not.**  


As John von Neumann famously put it.

https://preview.redd.it/6ottvag3vbx71.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e68a966a2d38d2528065f98a1c878e23d9188434

As with anything in life, there are tradeoffs, and even though the true ones are truly random, they are usually slower, and if not slower very expensive.  
And as with any physical device living in the physical world, it can break down and/or become unreliable.

So are the true random number generators better than the pseudo-random number generators?

Well is a wife better than a table?  
Even though one is more useful than the other, the question does not make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

# Entropy

You **can’t** measure randomness.  
You can observe a process and understand how it works and draw the conclusion that it is random or not.

But considering we are talking about numbers, after all, can’t we measure the numbers?  
Of course, we can say 8008 &gt; 1234 but saying that 8008 is more random than 1234, would not make any sense.

Whenever the topic of randomness is mentioned, entropy comes up very often, and depending on the context it can mean different things.

### The physics context

The term comes from Thermodynamics and it has to do with measuring molecular randomness, or in how many ways you can arrange the tiny things that make up something.  
And is used to express the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. 

“The entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.”

### The information theory context.

In 1948 Claude Shanon((Who was a crazy motherfucker! )) wanted to measure information and published a paper called  “A Mathematical Theory of Communication”, which pretty much give birth to this field.  
He popularised((But not come up with as he ""stole"" it from John Tukey)) the bit as the most minimal unit of information.

A bit can either be a 0 or a 1, something or nothing.

He started thinking about how many questions does he need to ask in order to guess all the digits of a string.  
Let’s say we have an 8 digit long binary number. Binary means that each digit can either be a 0 or a 1.

So how many questions do you need to ask me in order to guess my number?  
Well for the 1st character one question.  
You ask me is it a 0, and if I say no, you know it’s a 1.  
What about the 2nd character, the same.  
So in order to guess all the 8 characters, you need to ask me 8 questions.  
So the entropy of the string is 1 bit per character times 8 characters = 8 bits.

This is true only if you dont have any information about my string, let’s say you somehow found out that 4 of the digits are 1s, then you would require fewer questions.  
And of course, this gets more interesting and complicated when we have more options for each character, but for Bitcoin private keys, we keep everything in binary form.

Also in the paper, he estimated that the entropy of written English is between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per character, which is very low, and this is why it compresses so well((The higher the entropy is in a bitstring the less it can compress. Kinda makes sense as there are no patterns.)).  


So higher entropy would mean more secure, no?   
Well, not necessary.  
This does bring us closer to what we are interested in but not quite there.

### The cryptographic context.

You see Cryptography is just adversarial math.  
Meaning that we always frame stuff by how hard it’s for an adversary to guess the secret or alter data.

The way modern((Modern meaning after 1883 after Kerckhoffs formulated his 6 principles)) cryptography works is that everyone knows the algorithms we use, but none one knows the entropy.  
Like in Bitcoin everything is open-source, we know how every little thing works, and that’s great because that’s why we also trust the code because is auditable, but everyone’s, private keys are private and entropic(hopefully).

So good entropy would mean it’s hard(it will cost a LOT of resources) for an adversary to guess your secret, or in our case the Bitcoin private keys.

Good entropy has 3 characteristics: 

1. Unpredictability, which is a measure of how strong the non-computability of the bits in the sequence is; 
2. Uniform distribution of the bits in the sequence; 
3. Lack of patterns in the sequence. 

It is worth pointing out that 3 implies both 1 and 2.   
However, 1 does not imply 2.  
And similarly, 2 does not guarantee 1.

But not all entropy is equally important.

Some people use entropy to make simulations of the universe(or for video games) and they don’t need cryptographically secure entropy, because they dont have any adversaries to worry about.

So what is the actual difference between Shanon’s entropy and cryptographic entropy, seem to be the same?

Well, it is not.

For example, we can take the very well-known constant Pi.

Pi is a number that goes on forever, and to date, we calculated about 62.8 trillion((To put it into perspective this is 3 times more than there are blood cells in the human body*.*)) digits of it.   
The sequence of digits of Pi has all the proprieties listed above, but if we use that as entropy for our private keys, it’s trivial for anyone to guess.

The key difference is that generating the digits of Pi is **not a random process**, and it can be replicated by anyone with a computer, so from the adversarial POV, even though the entropy checks all the boxes, it would **not** serve as cryptographically secure entropy.

Ok, ok, but we are talking about Bitcoin here.  
This can((will\*)) be worth millions in the future, and I might even want to pass it on to other generations, so as entropy is so important what is the best entropy for my Bitcoin private keys?

I came to think the numbers can roughly support bitcoin at $208,000 in the current system. Still partially dependent on psychology:


It has value of bitcoin is predicated on the lack of value of the current monetary system. It's effectively an inverse relationship. With, some points of ""meme"" a dash of tulip.

However, so long as there is value in fiat, there will be value in stricter fiat. Along with a need for some sense of cultural ideal. Meaning that Bitcoin, is the psychological standard of crypto. Back when MySpace was better than Facebook, people moved due to psychological issues mostly. So this would be the greatest risk, but is not an easy thing with this type of situation to occur.

The issue and idk the numbers precisely is that crypto standard (if bitcoin stays as such) should eventually level out in the inverse relationship. This is, if there is 5 billion dollars and only 1 million bitcoin, so long as our monetary policy remains, then bitcoin should be worth what a dollar would be worth if there was only 1 million of them. While our system has fluctuations sort of, a great example I make is that in the 50s my grandfather's house cost 12k and Today would be worth about 500k. In the 50s it was worth about 343 ounces of gold and today is worth about 343 ounces of gold. Value doesn't change much, dollars devalue due to printing.

**There are 2.5 billion ounces of gold, and there will be 21 million bitcoin. Theoretically without meme factor, so long as the inverse relationship exists due to fiat systems, 1 bitcoin could be worth about 119 ounces of gold. Or in current prices 208,000 dollars.**

However, let's say in 50 years, my grandfather's house is worth 1 million, then it'll still be 343 ounces of gold. Which means bitcoin can be worth 416,000 dollars.

However it all depends on two prime factors:

1. Maintaining the current monetary system

2. Bitcoin remaining the standard of alternate currency.

Add on: If it became more exact to inverse of dollar, this would make bitcoin in terms of 20 trillion printed dollar go to $950,000. But this would be $8k gold ounces. I don't know that our system would level out that much with all the different factors involved, equities, speculations, artifical controls etc. I think you'd need a dollar crash (like removed from reserve currency status) to see that much of an impact.

Small improvements have been introduced over the year, also following Redditors' great suggestions.

Here is a recap of the major improvements compared to the very first version:

\- Background mountains: The most distant mountain profile shows the price curve in the last 24h, while the foregound mountains show the price in the last hour.

\- The bitcoin price appears on the tab title (in this way, it is possible to check the price also when working on other browser tabs)

\- Landscape additions: Clouds, birds, and shooting stars

The underlying question considers whether Bitcoin will have another lengthy bear market at all. To form your own opinion, it helps to know more about the discussed price movements. Bitcoin’s price shifts considerably, so it’s hard to distinguish the top from Bitcoin’s regular shenanigans.

A blow-off top shows a rapid price increase during which you can expect significant FOMO. Then, a steep drop follows. Both movements tend to happen with high volume, the amount of Bitcoin traded per time period. In the past two halving cycles, blow-off tops marked the start of bear markets that brought Bitcoin down by \~80%. 

This description has been rather abstract so far, so let’s take a look at the actual tops from 2013 and 2017. 

[2013 and 2017 Halving Cycle Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/uf3qiii7ncz71.png?width=979&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14ed9a3108d5a517f0f1356c35a5b374cc15023)

As you can see, both cycles had a price pullback shortly before the top. The local top before this pullback, if it happens again, will be misidentified as *the* top by many investors. Then, Bitcoin has another incredible rally to the blow-off top before it cracks with force in the other direction.

When Bitcoin begins its downtrend, it might be interrupted by brief periods of recovery. Bitcoin’s price rises, and investors start buying again with the expectation of the bull run to continue. Nevertheless, the price doesn’t reach the price levels of the prior blow-off top and continues its prolonged decline.

Consider indicators that your idea of the situation is wrong rather than right. What if the price climbs back up dangerously close to the point you identified as blow-off top? In this case, Bitcoin might very well continue a walk to higher prices in a last-cycle/supercycle scenario. What if the supposed last pullback before the top starts to look dangerously like an actual blow-off top? Thinking like this keeps you grounded and prepares you for these emotional situations.

&amp;#x200B;

[Halving Cycle Risk Scenarios](https://preview.redd.it/7jjh9fn9ncz71.png?width=979&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4bb364747644cc8ce70ba7818bd833fe4fc17c1)

Knowing about the past cycles is a powerful help, but you shouldn’t blindly assume that history will repeat itself. Nevertheless, you can prepare well in case it rhymes. Take the time to contemplate how different events will affect your plan and how you want to act in specific situations. I hope this has contributed to helping you stay in control in the turbulent times ahead.

Independent inherent value estmation meant that the value of btc would be determined by its adoption rate. The more people believe in it the more value it will hold.

A decade later these two underlying principles have been challenged.

Regulation is coming, like it or not. It will shave of 40-50% of profits and give them to the taxman.

More importantly people do not believe in the inherent value of bitcoin. A tweet from a retard like Elon Musk can fluctuate the market wildly.

If Elon tweeted that Diamonds are worthless would you believe him? 

This shows that institutional investors like Tesla and Apple can fluctuate the value of btc. And this value forms a part of their company's capital structure.

The value of btc, with more and more cpmpanies getting involved is now tied to their share price.

I would not be surprised if BTC goes up when Tesla performs well and goes down if Apple shares take a hit.

This dependence of value on institutional interest will ultimately make btc a market manipulation to in the hands of the few.

For now you need it to spend on most things still but holding it is a liability. It's designed to lose its worth, so you have to spend it or buy assets. It's good for the masses to keep it in circulation.

Anyway - the point that dawned on me was this: **It isn't that assets appreciate, it's more that they just don't lose value like cash**. Take a range of asset classes like property, gold, etc. It looks like their value increases, but on average what you're seeing is just what the money you purchased them with *would* be worth if it weren't designed to deflate.

It's not assets increasing in worth - it's the dollars they cost falling in value. They're really just a hedge against inflation. Some better and worse than others.

Monetary policy erodes savings.

The average person can't get an interest rate to beat inflation, and when they do they are taxed on it - even where the real value of their money is *less*.

One of the wonderful things about **bitcoin** is that eventually everyone will be able to have **savings that don't lose value.** People won't have to hand money to a bank or investment fund where the financial industry take their cut.

Imagine millions of people whose savings can be relied upon, where if you do nothing after 2, 5 or 10 years no government or financial institution has robbed them of their value.

At this point I know BTC will need to go through another crash, as mining activities will be removed or reduced in Europe in order to reach the 1.5C Paris climate goal. And I’m bracing for that potential smash on holders and miners assets.

If we can’t mine on Earth, we can always do it outside of Earth, or just stop mining completely and let BTC go for PoS or other consensus which protocol uses PoS or something else. But with space tourism becoming even more real as we progress into the new tech era, rockets become more efficient and inexpensive, so does BTC mining (Taproot Upgrade) and solar panel efficiency (breaking the 30% mark).

Taproot is arguably the biggest upgrade to Bitcoin's base-layer protocol, introducing a new signature algorithm and scripting language. It brings a set of protocols that enhance Bitcoin's privacy, security, scalability, fungibility and unlocks the infrastructure that will allow for seamless integration of L2/sidechain application protocols on Bitcoin.

Taproot was activated through the ""speedy trial"" approach. Under the speedy trial, miners were given three months to signal support for Taproot after the code was shipped. This required 90% of the blocks in a difficulty epoch(2016 blocks) to signal for Taproot. Activation was achieved at block height 687284 back in June.

Although some of the ideas included in the upgrade have been discussed for many years, the final iteration of Taproot was proposed by Bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell in 2018. The upgrade is named after one of the three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) included in the upgrade - Schnorr Signatures(BIP 340), Taproot(BIP 341) and Tapscript(BIP 342).

By combining the Schnorr signatures with MAST (Merklized Alternative Script Tree) and introducing a new, slightly modified scripting language called Tapscript, Taproot expands Bitcoin's smart contract capabilities, while offering more privacy and security by making multi-signature transactions and complex smart contracts indistinguishable from regular bitcoin transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schnorr signatures (BIP 340)** 

This part of the upgrade is a change to Bitcoin's cryptographic digital signature algorithm. In asymmetric cryptography ([public-private key pairs](https://getbitcoinclarity.com/blog/2020/05/16/what-is-a-bitcoin-private-key)), digital signature algorithms define the generation of digital signatures using a private key that proves the ownership of a corresponding public key.

The existing Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) of Bitcoin will not be replaced, but Schnorr signatures will be implemented in addition to it.

The Schnorr digital signature algorithm allows for something called key and signature aggregation using a protocol known as MuSig - multiple signatures created using multiple private keys corresponding to multiple public keys are combined to produce a single cryptographic digital signature corresponding to a single public key recorded on the blockchain.

[Key and signature aggregation](https://i.redd.it/0ltnzwzwhdz71.gif)

In addition to Schnorr signatures and public keys being smaller than ECDSA signatures and public keys, aggregation further helps reduce the footprint of multi-signature transactions and complex smart contracts, which will take up the same space as regular single-signature transactions and as all transactions will look indistinguishable on the blockchain, the privacy benefits are fairly obvious. The privacy also extends to Lightning Network as on-chain transactions to open and close Lightning channels can no longer be identified from the keys and signatures in the channel or the script used.

Unlike ECDSA signatures, Schnorr signatures are provably secure and inherently non-malleable, meaning a third party cannot alter an existing valid signature under any circumstance. Segregated Witness ([SegWit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segregated_Witness)) addressed transaction malleability, Schnorr signatures address signature malleability.

There are also significant computational benefits for nodes, as key aggregation will allow nodes to verify signatures in batches, but these benefits can only be realized with time once Schnorr signatures become widely adopted.

Modifying the digital signature algorithm, per se, doesn't affect anything on the blockchain. Schnorr is a different, more efficient way of generating digital signatures.

When Satoshi originally developed Bitcoin, Claus Peter Schnorr, the inventor of Schnorr signatures, had a patent on it. It is speculated that Satoshi may have otherwise opted for Schnorr signatures over ECDSA, which was a rigorously tested open-source alternative developed later, even if in a somewhat obligately inefficient manner as to not constitute an infringement of the patent, which expired in 2008.

There was a suggestion to use a different name, Discrete Logarithm Signatures was briefly mooted, while adapting Schnorr signatures for Bitcoin as some people felt that Claus Peter Schnorr's name shouldn't be used in association with Bitcoin after he prevented the widespread use of such a powerful signature scheme for over 20 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Taproot (BIP 341)**

This part of the upgrade leverages the Schnorr signature scheme to enable Merklized Alternative Script Trees (MAST) and defines the rules for a new output type based on SegWit known as Pay-to-Taproot(P2TR), which leverages the capabilities of Schnorr signatures.

MAST is a privacy solution that uses Merkle trees as part of the script's structure to address some long-standing issues with transactions using Pay-to-Script Hash ([P2SH](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Pay-to-Script_Hash)) and Pay-to-Pubkey Hash ([P2PKH](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Pay-to-Pubkey_Hash)) locking scripts where all possible spending conditions of a transaction are revealed.

[P2TR significantly optimizes for block space economy](https://preview.redd.it/999sm0e8fez71.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d103670aa5e755adc77c940ce1c243c61180b4c)

P2TR combines two separate locking scripts - P2SH and Pay to Pubkey ([P2PK](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2pk)), which is a simpler version of P2PKH that locks an output to the public key rather than a hash of the public key.

This allows P2TR outputs to be spent by either a script (smart contract) or a public key, but by allowing different spending conditions of the output to be individually hashed only the specific spending condition met is revealed and thanks to Schnorr signatures, they're all indistinguishable on the blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tapscript (BIP 342)**

This part of the upgrade modifies Bitcoin's scripting language to enable the new transaction types introduced by the two proposals above using new opcodes (operation codes), which are commands in Bitcoin scripts with predefined functions.

The goal of Tapscript is to make Schnorr signatures, batch verification and signature hash improvements available to spends that use the script path as well as the public key path. It enables nodes to create and validate P2TR outputs.

Existing signature opcodes for ECDSA are modified to verify Schnorr signatures. Two existing opcodes that define verification of multi-signature transactions are disabled and replaced with a new opcode (OP\_CHECKSIGADD) to enable batch verification of signatures.

Tapscript also allows adding new signature validation rules through softforks and introduces another new opcode (OP\_SUCCESS) to enable the seamless introduction of future opcodes to Tapscript.

&amp;#x200B;

**Impact of Taproot**

Bitcoin's script is deliberately limited and intentionally non-Turing complete in order to retain simplicity, security and efficiency. Linear optimization is one of the main considerations for upgrades to the script to ensure decentralization - that any individual can economically self-host a node and trustlessly validate the blockchain.

Taproot is a forward-compatible soft fork, meaning old non-upgraded nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid. At the time of writing, more than [53%](https://twitter.com/taproot_signal/status/1459415738117144577) of \~ 60,000 Bitcoin nodes support Taproot. Non-enforcing nodes will reject transactions spending from P2TR outputs until they upgrade node software but will accept blocks containing transactions spending from P2TR outputs.

The significance of Taproot cannot be measured merely by what the above proposals enable for Bitcoin but what they represent for the future of Bitcoin, by introducing new tools to make future upgrades easier to implement, simpler, safer and more private.

Such upgrades waiting in the wings include cross-input signature aggregation, channel factories, state chains and covenants, which enable advanced application protocols to be built on top of Bitcoin without placing any undue burden on full-node users, thereby preserving Bitcoin's inviolable security and decentralization.",3552530,"Taproot: Privacy, Security, Scalability and truly decentralized application protocols",0,1.0,2021-11-13 20:25:03,POSITIVE,0.9979411959648132

The answer is that they have value because they have ostensibly limited supply, growth potential, and produce something. Bitcoin PRODUCES bitcoin, that's literally what the ledger and its miners do every 10 minutes, roughly 10k times more frequently the quarterly earnings of large firms, and bitcoin simultaneously ALSO provides the services (amongst others) of wealth storage and secure, trustless financial transactions.

It seems like the bleeding edge of backup technology is moving away  from Mnemonics, and towards output script descriptors, as described in  BIP380 to BIP386. Why?

&gt;...mnemonics  rely on all wallets using a single key with the same, single script:  pay-to-public-key. If we want to keep (and improve!) recovery  interoperability in a world of payment channels and multisig vaults, we  need to work on new backup and recovery mechanisms.  
Enter  output script descriptors (BIP380 to BIP386). Designed by Pieter Wuille  and Andrew Chow, descriptors provide a human-readable way to express  any combination of keys, scripts, derivation paths, and address types  without ambiguity. These descriptors allow a program to discover and  spend funds from any given script in a fully interoperable manner.

Just substitute the word 'Bitcoin' for the word 'Internet' and you'll have the answer: Those questions make no sense because Bitcoin, like the Internet, is an open-source decentralized protocol.

Just like the second layer apps on top of the Internet (TCP/IP) base protocol, everything will be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol.

Base layers/protocols are basic infrastructure built for security not for 'speed', are a strong and stable foundation upon which all the functional layers are built on top of.

In your house you are building you want high-voltage electrical wires, solar panels, double-panneled windows, central AC, a pool and jacuzzi, extra rooms for visitors. etc? You build all of that on top of the strong foundation, not buried on the cement and unable to change, upgrade or even use them.


So, almost everything will be implemented on top of Bitcoin, just see some the advances so far this early in the game:

(Note: Everytning shown below are NOT shitcoins, all of them are projects/apps on 2L's, Side-Chains, State-Chains, Sidetrees, etc. ALL ON TOP OF BITCOIN).

&gt; &gt; RSK Network, the safest smart contract platform in the world that is secured by the Bitcoin Network, has surpassed Lighting Network (LN) total value locked in Bitcoin (BTC), and now stands at 1,445 BTCs locked. The latest milestone is another sign of a strong appetite among users for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector, which defined 2020 and has extended well into the current year.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; RSK smart contracts platform had over 259,000 transactions, 50,000 active accounts and reached an all time high of 72% hashing power during April. The amount of solutions and integrations in the RSK defi ecosystem has experienced a significant growth over the last couple of months.

&gt; &gt; A new project built on the Bitcoin sidechain RSK is gunning to advance decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin’s ecosystem.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Sovryn, a self-billed “decentralized platform for trading and lending Bitcoin,” launched today with $2.1 million at its back – a symbolic number representing Bitcoin’s total supply. Crypto venture capital firm Greenfield One led the funding round, which also saw contributions from Collider Ventures and Monday Capital.

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; RGB is not a token protocol. Though issuance and management of highly scalable, programmable and private assets of different sort is possible with RGB, it can be applied in many indusrtied far beyond financial world.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; As a smart contract system RGB is quite different from previous approaches, both Bitcoin-based (Colored coins, Counterparty, OMNI) and non-bitcoin (Ethereum, EOS and others):
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * RGB separates concept of smart contract issuer, state owners and state evolution
&gt; &gt;  
&gt; &gt; * RGB keeps the smart contract code and data off-chain
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * RGB uses blockchain as a state commitment layer and Bitcoin script as an ownership control system; while smart contract evolution is defined by off-chain schema

If a satoshi reached parity with $0.01 this would value Bitcoin at $1 million and the diluted market cap of Bitcoin at $21 trillion, roughly equal to the US M2 Money supply, however, considerably less than global money supply, quoted as up to $90 trillion. Therefore to adopt Bitcoin to a stage of global currency, would put it past $0.01 per satoshi and so theoretically would bring obstacles to transactions on small scales, increasingly noticeable fees on layer 2 solutions such as the Lighting network and disruption to operations of financial markets operations. Considering this potential issue, I have a few questions.

1) Is this a potential issue with divisibilty or is my interpretation off?

2) Is this a quick fix in the bitcoin protocol or would an update to address this issue create a version that is not backwards compatible with previous versions of the bitcoin software and possibly cause a hard fork?

3) Are layer 2 or further solutions the most likely outcome whereby smart contracts just further divide bitcoin up and move the decimal place, and if so does this run into any complications when attempting to settle on the main Bitcoin blockchain.

Only trouble is that the good / valuable ones havent been released yet. The only legit seller I could find is [""@hogwartsworld.io](mailto:%22@hogwartsworld.io)"" on instagram because they are affiliated with the actual actors from harry potter but they havent actually released the NFTs yet, but the drop is coming soon so I'm eagerly waiting haha.

 Theyre doing a giveaway too for $10,000 so hopefully I get picked lol. I was looking at some harry potter fan pages and my gosh the fan base is much bigger than I thought and a lot of them are heavily invested into the community.

(Deflation spiral)

Deflation in this sense means, when the prices of goods keep decreasing. And the value of the currency keeps increasing. (The opposite of inflation) 

An other aspect is the deflating total amount of Bitcoin, but I understand, that this is solved by the divideability. That why I want to focus on the economic deflation of the value of goods.

I read throw mulitple article on the subject (including the linked FAQ in the sidebar) and found the following solutions Bitcoin offers:

- There are no loans in Bitcoin, so the repaying of loans can't cause deflation.

- After a certain date (2140? earlier?) Bitcoin will enter value stability, after this Bitcoin can become the standard currency.

My remaining questions on these problems:

- What prevents the creation of loans in Bitcoin? Just the deflation itself?

- If this is the case, in time of low deflation(or inflation), Bitcoin loans could still be created? And then still cause deflation later?

- Many articles are very sure, that Bitcoin will enter value stability (or close to it) on it's own, but fail to explain why/how. Can someone explain how a limited-supply currency can enter value stability? Seems kinda unlikely after universal adoption and in economic climate of deflation.

Me being the tech and finance savvy IT pro that I am, she thankfully believed everything I said without question. I already have alot of bitcoin as you can probably see from my earlier posts. 

I wanted to make it literally dummy simple easy. So i made a coinbase account for her. She started with a humble investment of about $300 a year ago. That's it. (Honestly It's literally the same strategy I used 5 years ago just without altcoins).

The next day, I asked her if she was going to reinvest and she was not sure. So i said ""well why don't we just set up autopay for just $30 a week, EVERY week no exceptions."" That way she won't even notice the money is gone. 

So that entire time from about a year ago, she was investing literally just $30 a week. All the way from its highs of $65,000, all the way to the $30K lows a while back. The account balance has grown from that $300 to just under $4,000. 

She was SHOCKED, blown away. She was slaving away for 10+ years at her job at 50 years old just to accumulate a $50K 401K. Here I was under 30 years old and I have more than DOUBLE what she has saved in her 401K. I think it's safe to say that she ""gets it"" now.

Most of them are aware of the only thing which is *trading* and it can quite risky if you do not know what you are doing.

Apart from these, I have complied some other ideas that I see quite a lot in the crypto space, thought I'd share them here and help out any budding entrepreneurs looking to get into the bitcoin ecosystem;

**#1 Mining:** Backbone of proof of work coins, mining will remain active as long as the coin is active. But, bitcoin mining is highly monopolized by big corporations and requires a significant investment to create a profitable business. Do explore altcoins here.

**#2 Crypto Exchange**: The second most popular business venture in the crypto space is an exchange, which allows users to buy, sell, trade, coins. The majority of the world is still inaccessible to crypto and there is definitely scope in this type of company. Plus, it will take some power away from highly monopolized exchanges that currently run the market.  

**# 3 Bitcoin Course:** A simple, easy venture that can be started with just a laptop, courses are a great way to spread knowledge as well as create a passive income stream. 

**#4 Game:** Gaming is the hot topic right now and only increase in the future, creating a blockchain-based game can be highly successful.  

**#5 eCommerce Site:** Selling products/services for bitcoin is as basic as it gets when it comes to commerce. Bitcoin-accepting businesses are increasing as people are more open to crypto now. If you have a product to sell then don't hesitate to accept bitcoin for it. 

**#6 Something Unique:** The bitcoin market is fairly new and it is not even close to its full potential yet. You can always create something completely new and unique and wow the market.

First, I’m going to say this not a financial advise. 

In order to do this, we need to already have invested the amount of money we decided to set as goal to invest in this market. 

Here’s how it goes: 

Let’s say I invested $10,000 and DCA to a final price of Bitcoin at $50k. I should have 0.2 BTC and I feel comfortable with it. 

Bitcoin price reaches 100k and decided I want more satoshis, so I put a few extra $1,000 at this price. Now I hace 0.21 BTC. But I’m not tanino those $1,000 in my DCA tracking spreadsheet. But I do have more BTC. 

So, doing the math, my BTC DCA price should be $47,619.05. That gives a mental peace, because I’m getting more sats and not ruining my DCA price, but improving it. 

And that’s it, guys. That’s the ape method to DCA down. Hope you enjoyed this math trick.",3559885,"How to DCA down, even if the price is up.",0,1.0,2021-11-15 12:11:54,NEGATIVE,0.9462983012199402

Some of the most prolific influencers have been talking about a possible correction around mid-to-late November, just before the final run to the top.

**Guy, from Coin Bureau, stated in his latest videos / newsletters:**

&gt;I think we’re on the cusp of another correction, and not just because we’ve hit another market cap milestone.

He then expands about the macro factors that could drive this potential drop, like

the Federal Reserve recent confirmation that they will reduce their government bond purchases and how this could increase interest rates in response. As a result, this could mean less demand by consumers and less investment by companies.

Also, if the FED’s tapering manages to reduce inflation, the demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors could potentially drop. 

One final red flag mentioned by Guy is the FATF’s crypto “recommendations” and a potential global crackdown on cryptocurrency in the name of money laundering.

**Bob Loukas, who at this point enjoys a prestigious trader status for all the accurate predictions he’s made in the past**, shared this chart in his last youtube video published on the 15th of October (notice the dip around mid-November):

**TechDev\_52, a must-follow on Twitter (who also seems to always hit the hammer on the nail with his charts and analysis)**, published this interesting comparison chart:

&amp;#x200B;

[Source: TechDev\_52 Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/g372x05masy71.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdccdc778e8866d4a25c682de6b4befb88191f33)

He is comparing the 2017 bull run - which had a significant pullback around mid-November - to the current market situation, and also projects a dip around the same time frame.

# Why one last dip would be beneficial to the market

**From where I’m standing, this event would serve two purposes:**

1. The obvious opportunity to stack more sats, both for seasoned investors and newcomers. By now, the veterans are most likely comfortable with their holdings and may or may not capitalize in the event of a dip.   
For newcomers though, it’s a completely different story, as they love to ask their crypto savvy friends “is this a good time to buy?”. This retrace would provide the affirmative answer and one last opportunity to increase the inflow of new investors at a crucial phase, accelerating adoption and boosting the final market capitalization for this cycle.
2. This could also further extend the cycle well into the first quarter of 2022. Extending the cycle could also allow for more hype and proliferation, and thus achieve a higher top.

# TLDR

Everyone and their dog is super bullish on BTC. There are clear skies ahead for it to reach 100k+, but some experts believe we are due for a correction before we resume the run to the top of this cycle. 

**What are your thoughts on this?**

I see some not so good consequences. I'm not an expert on economy so I may have gotten it wrong. Curious what others think.

1. With Bitcoin as the dominant store of value the government cannot print money effectively. This sounds like a good thing. But didn't printing money keep the economy afloat during the pandemic? Without control of the country's currency, the government wouldn't be able to respond to shocks like these.

2. The supply of Bitcoin is limited but number of people and goods is growing. Wouldn't this mean that price of Bitcoin denominated in goods would keep growing? (Or, to put it differently, prices of goods and salaries in Bitcoin would continue to decrease). Older generations would have a lot more wealth then new ones. The advantage of capital over labor would be a lot bigger than now.

3. As the price of Bitcoin kept growing, wouldn't this cause extreme wealth inequality (even worse than now) since Bitcoin ownership is very concentrated? Also many criminals likely keep their assets in cryptocurrency as it allows them to avoid detection. They would become extremely rich and therefore have an outstanding influence. Ross Ulbricht supposedly owned as much as 600,000 Bitcoin. This would make him one of the richest men today if he didn't get caught. With Bitcoin as dominant currency, he could buy Musk and Bezos assets and barely notice it.

I'm using a brand new MacBook, with FileVault always-on. Without iCloud backup/access, so only I have the access even if the shit hits the fan.

I create a new wallet and secured seed phrase with a password. Insanely long password following best practices and stored to zero-knowledge architecture vault.

The seed phrase is stored in the same location, literally, I'm the only person who has access to it. The master key to the vault is only in my head and required 2fa - atm Google, but I'll switch to yubikey later.

The reason why I'm not just going with the cold storage is bc I'm actively trading on DEXes. But I'd like to build as secure ""main hot wallet(s)"" as possible, and whenever I trade I move smaller amounts to multiple different addresses. Depending on whatever the trade plan is. This way my main accounts are never connected to any extensions or stuff like that.

The only security threats I can think of is the following:

1) Malware software listening all my copy-pastes &amp; keystrokes

* So if I copy-paste pubkey, seed &amp; password I just gave all the info to the hacker

To protect myself from this scenario, I'd use ReiKey &amp; LuLu to know more about what's going on with the system, and what listens to what events, etc.

ReiKey: https://objective-see.com/products/reikey.html

LuLu: https://objective-see.com/products/lulu.html

A top of that, I'd copy-paste the info in multiple different chunks. Making it very difficult for the hacker to combine the info.

2) Malware software to screen record.

* Tbh, the only way to protect yourself from this is to follow security best practices when downloading stuff from online or executing apps and never let things go to this point that some1 is seriously recording your screen. Plus, I think that's not realistic unless it is a personal attack, bc it is very slow way for the hacker to get info unless s/he knows exactly what it is looking for.

  
In the end, the biggest security threat is the human themselves. No software can protect us from our own stupidity.

In 2013, China discovered Bitcoin, and was the main driver of investment growth.  When the most populated country int he world discovers your investment is incredible, expect sunshine and rainbows.  Bitcoin goes from $150 to $1180

In 2017, nothing happened in Bitcoin late in the year until the CME released Bitcoin Futures to the market. Bitcoin goes from $2k to $20k.

What is spurring Bitcoin growth late in 2021?  So far......nothing.  So don't be shocked if Bitcoin loafs around, not even breaking $100k this year.  Bitcoin needs a spark to start this fire. Being cool and sexy only gets you 100% or so. You want more, you have to do more.

A Spot ETF could ignite a ""Supercycle,"" but don't hold your breath. 

Mad Max Keiser said $220k is the number for the end of the year.  Not seeing that.

I thought $150-175k would be a nice 500% post-halving jump, but that seems like a long way off.

Just passing $100k will take at least 2 weeks, as plenty of people will be dumping at that price.

I originally started buying the coin in 2011 to use it on the silk road. I remember back when I could buy a bitcoin for about $35usd. I had an account that had a few bitcoins in it but I didn't pay it any mind at the time. Back when bitcoin first hit 1k I had just graduated high school. I thought there was no way it could go any higher for an internet coin. I sold most of my bitcoin and ended up buying my dream car at the time which was a Camaro ss. I thought I made the smartest move in the world and practically got this car for next to nothing (which in hindsight is a depreciating asset). 

fast forward about a year from there and then bitcoin hit $20k, I thought it was absolutely insane and I sold my remaining coins.  It was all over the news at the time and I thought it was just a big bubble. I always thought to myself that I would be able to buy back in under that $1,000 mark but as you guys know that never happened. 

I kept waiting for the dip and then we flew past $20k and went up to $50k. After that happened I was happy and pissed. It really cemented the idea that bitcoin isn't going anywhere and people want it. But on the other hand I probably own one of the most expensive Camaros on the planet. I knew after seeing this that I needed to get back into bitcoin. 

I waited for the dip to happen and told myself I was going to keep buying it on the downtrend because I knew I wouldn't be able to guess the bottom price. I managed to get the majority of my bitcoin at $35k.

I told myself that I'm not going to make the same mistake I have in the past. I plan on holding this until I'm old and wrinkly. Even with that being said it's very hard for me to not sell right now. The way I've combated this is I sent aside a very small percentage and I ""day trade"" with that. The rest I have in cold storage and I've pretty much blocked it out of my mind. 

What I'm mainly trying to say is that even though so many people on here claim to never sell it's very hard to do so. All of us have to sell at some point or there would be no point in investing into crypto right? 

My advice would be set aside some coins you truly believe in and have a set date when you will sell them or a time frame. If I had a portion of the bitcoin I had almost 10 years ago I would be a very very rich man. Also on the other end of it, don't ever be upset about making a profit but you missed making a potentially higher profit. Yea it sucks but you still made money. Selling my bitcoin and making a profit on it is what has kept me interested in bitcoin. I truly believe crypto is my opportunity to set my family up for the rest of our lives, I don't want to look back and regret it just I regret selling at $1k.

I came across a German newspaper article (Link below) which is stating that Bitcoin is provoking a new feudalism and Bitcoin is failing in its aim to create a more equitable financial system.

Some of the arguments are:

* Only 2258 Bitcoin wallets with more than 1000 BTC exist (31st Dec 2020). Overall these wallets own 7.9 million BTC. There are too less remaining coins (around 2.3 million) to solve this unequal distribution.
* 10% of the miners are controlling 90% of the Hash Power. Furthermore, there are 0.1% of the miners controlling 50% of the Hash Power.

My questions:

1. How would you respond to these arguments?
2. What does this mean for all cryptocurrencies, especially Proof of Stake ones? I know that some of these PoS projects try to prevent such cases implicitly in their protocols/source code , e.g, that the holders owning a large amount of the coin cannot get the control over the network or get too much voting power in any decisions about improvement proposals.

I will explain why in a moment because I have tried various methods with different sets of problems, but before I do, is there any better way to store my seed phrase?

I have a hardware wallet that it was generated on + another hardware wallet with the seed on it as a backup, so I guess the real question is how would I absolutely guarantee lifespan of the hardware wallet? How would you protect it against fire, electronic interference (emp? solar flare?) or anything else that can threaten such a small electronic device in long term storage?

With that out of the way, here are the methods I have tried and the problems I ran into with each.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 1** \- **t**hose hardware wallets where you insert the metal letterings

Easy but is the most prone to error over time since the letters can fall out, be re-arranged etc. No real problems otherwise, I just don't think its sustainable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 2** \- letter stamping

I found this frustrating. When stamping the letter into the metal, there is always a risk the lettering tools bounce back up off the surface of the metal, which causes the position to be off just slightly enough to ruin the lettering. You have to do this on an absolutely solid surface. No desks or weak work benches. You need solid concrete floor, thick metal, or something that can absorb the shock of the lettering tools hitting the metal plates. I also kept stamping letters backwards.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 3** \- dot grid stamping

I have ruined these because my eyes fool me and I end up stamping a dot into the wrong box on the metal grid. There are various designs that attempt to make this easier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 4** \- chemical etching

This is my latest try. The idea is you etch into this varnish and then use a chemical process to etch into the metal where the varnish was scraped. This requires manually etching letters onto the surface and my handwriting skills on paper are terrible. Getting this right on a rough metal surface is no easy task and in my case, its physically painful on my hands. I have not gotten to the chemical part of this process yet.

I am just desperate to get a good physically secure solution going, but its really been more of an effort than any steel wallet manufacturer or content creator will tell you.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, should I consider a multi-sig solution with an institution? That way I can scale back and then store my seed phrase in a password manager instead?",3542999,Better seed storage solutions than on physical metal?,0,1.0,2021-11-11 20:03:33,NEGATIVE,0.9713517427444458

Clearly we all do, the price to buy some is up and down like a bride's nightie. 

Let's assume that I want to accumulate a whole coin and I'm prepared to sell my house to do it. No remortgage, no loan, straight swap, 1 Bitcoin for one house. Yeah, yeah, yeah, dumb, I could do x,y,z instead, but bear with me, is my thinking correct? I'm not talking about today, or in 4 years or even 8, but in principal, can I got me a whole coin in exchange for my house and be happy about it?

At the moment we really can't all agree what BTC is worth to us and so the price is not steady. If everyone that has some BTC wants more BTC - the way most hodlers do, we don't sell but keep buying - the price will rise, particularly once it has all been mined because where is it going to come from? There's no new BTC supply. I'm going to have to offer someone a lot to persuade them to part with something they're trying to accumulate too. Like, maybe my house to get just one BTC. Maybe they'll part with one coin to get my house in exchange. So now my house value is 1BTC.  That one BTC has risen in value, since I had to sell 5 BTC buy the house back in the day. 

Is the house cheaper? No. I'm just using a deflationary currency to buy with, instead of an inflationary one like the dollar. The problem with an inflationary currency is you need more and more of it to buy the same thing. BTC will be the opposite.

This is my first time posting here, hopefully i dont cross any lines in terms of rules.  
In case its a scam site, I AM NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SPEND MONEY THERE, just to be sure not to get banned hopefully.

  
I'm kinda new to all this, i have always followed the bitcoin trend but never acted on it and just created a bitcoin wallet a few weeks ago.  
I got hold on a Promo code, which is way to much to be real I thought, and i still think, since usually things that look too good to be true mostly are.  


It was a code for [Spolerbit.com](https://Spolerbit.com), I created an account, put in the code and now at least it shows i have that amount it said it would give me.

The catch why i feel like its some kind of fraud/scam is the verification of ""only"" 0.01 BTC, which is just about 650 USD atm, which is absolutely needed to withdraw or act on the promo based BTC.

I know that there are similar posts on here, on well sue me.  I was talking to a person at work the other day who came from another country. Moved to the US about six years ago. With their first earnings here they traveled home and opened a bank account in South America with a few thousand dollars. The thought seemed very logical, that it would be available to their family if there was an emergency.  They looked the other day and the account value is the same as the day that they opened it.  

They asked to withdraw the funds so that they could move the funds somewhere else so that it can appreciate instead of just sit there. The bank said they could do that but they would have to go into the bank branch where they opened the account that it could not be done over the phone. They explained that they were in the US and could not do that anytime soon. The bank said, sorry that is the only way. 
 
This same person has been buying bitcoin for at least a few months now, the trigger for them was Western Union. This bank issue only solidified their commitment.  They were telling me that apparently Western Union sets their own conversion rate regardless of the market rate.

My name is Paco, and I am crazy enough to want to travel to 40 countries in 400 days, only with Bitcoin. Bear with me please, here’s why.

I am a self-motivated traveler and I have been couch-surfing for the last 6 years.

In 2007 when I came to India for education, $1=38rs,

and now it’s 2021, $1=76rs.

In 2000 Argentina was $1 = 1Peso,

In 2018 during my travel, it was $1 = 25 Pesos,

2021 the same $1 = 100 Pesos.

You know how the story goes. You guys know it way better than me.

Throughout my journey, over the years I have seen plights of citizens in these hyperinflating regions. Folks, running like crazy every day to make their ends meet.

Recently a friend of mine gave me the book “The Bitcoin Standard” and I have been going down the rabbit hole ever since. Over my study in the last few weeks, it went like a blaze, and I could see how many experiences I had from my past travels were correlated with the plights of the fiat currency world.

I came to believe that “sound money”, that people can take their own custody of, is necessary for a working society, and Bitcoin is a possible way to achieve that. Although I don’t know much about how it works under the hood, I feel at home looking at the ethos and dreams of the Bitcoin community, striving for a bitcoinized world. And I wanna be part of that story.

My past travels and experiences provided me a direct path to achieve that. I have been running around the world since I was 24. I will run again, and this time I will do it with Bitcoin while vlogging my entire journey. I will spend in Bitcoin, I will earn in Bitcoin, I will receive your love in Bitcoin, and I will talk about Bitcoin and try to convince whoever I can to accept Bitcoin from me as a payment.

And most importantly I will come and meet with all you Bitcoiners out there in the world and share the love. No matter where you are, I am gonna find you, and I am gonna hug you.

So come along on this wild ride with me. Support me with donations, arrangements, hosting, or just prayers and kind words.

One day we will meet each other at the dawn of HyperBitcoinization, at the end of our current Fiat Tyranny. Till then keep fighting the good fight.

Why am I doing this?

Mass Awareness &amp; Show the kindness of Humans of Bitcoin around the world through the vlogs that will be shared on my youtube channel. The world is a kind place.


Over and out.

If you own crypto (have your own wallet and private keys) please remember to do every once in a while your DR test.

What is it? 

It is testing and making sure you can recover from a major loss. Let me share what it means for crypto and hardware wallets (the most common and recommended way for most people):

You buy two wallets. You set one of them, taking notes of the seed phrases. Get those seed phrases and 'recover' in the second one. Then you send some small amount of founds and check both wallets displays the correct founds and data.

Once you done that, you use your primary wallet normally.

Every once in a while, I recommend every 3 months or so, but it can be ok once a year. You go and wipe one of them. Then you try to recover from the seed.

This is not to check if the hardware is working, but to make sure you have the seed correctly stored, and is aware and ready to quickly recover if need be.

In case of failure to recover, you can proceed repeating the setup step in other two wallets and recover from the compromised one without loosing funds.

Leaving only 1.5 billion people with access to full service bank accounts with access to international utility and internationally accepted bank cards.

This video shows Andreas Antonopoulos going into detail about this problem;

https://youtu.be/W-Y_F3PS4JE

The problem is not a lack of money it is a lack of identity documents, a lack of a recognised employer, a lack of immigration status, and even a lack of social status in many countries, if you don't look like you belong inside a bank the guards won't even let you inside the building. In most of the world banking is seen as an elitist luxury that many are shut out from and if they can get banking they can only get a single currency deposit account with a card that can only be used at local ATMs, these cards cannot even be used to purchase things online let alone overseas. These people have money to spend they just dont have that special card with visa written on the side that allows them to join the rest of the travelling world.

The problem is profound and obvious and cannot be solved by banks even if they try to offer centralised mobile money apps, because these don't interoperate and dont scale internationally. Bitcoin is the only way to solve this problem.

You cannot travel internationally paying with cash, hotels and airlines strictly require credit cards to start with, and who wants to hold all their holiday funds in cash in their suitcase. So this would suggest only 1.5 billion people on earth have the ability to travel internationally.

Given the global border closures now there are plenty of hard hit tourism based countries that desperately need to boost their tourism sector by encouraging visitors. Turning their economy towards accepting bitcoin as legal tender would essentially open up travel to those other 6 billion underbanked people around the world. Instead of trying to deal with getting a bank account to go on holiday they would need nothing more than a bitcoin wallet to allow them to enjoy a holiday.

Allowing bitcoin as legal tender increases a countries potential number of tourists by five times. That is a huge opportunity.

Take a country that had 100 million visitors in 2019 and now has 5 million. They want to return to that previous number but it will take many years. Allowing bitcoin as legal tender could potentially speed up this recovery tremendously. Instead of taking until 2025 to return to normal tourist levels they could be back to those levels by 2023.

Then there is the fact these 6 billion unbanked people are like an untapped resource that have always wanted to travel but can't because the headache of banks has always stood in their way. The first countries that offer them the ability to travel with nothing but a bitcoin wallet will benefit tremendously. We see this already with the boost in tourisim to El Salvador.

In summary: If you are a country that wants to boost tourism then turning your economy towards accepting bitcoin would increase your market of potential tourists by five times and tap a cohort of tourists that have always been deprived of international travel.",3611547,Adopting bitcoin could potentially increase your countries pre-pandemic tourist numbers by 400% adding billions in GDP as a way to assist economic recovery over the coming years.,0,1.0,2021-11-28 23:17:37,NEGATIVE,0.6560506224632263

Background: I'm researching how to get my BTC off exchanges and started using Electrum. The more I read about hot wallets like Electrum, the more I want a hardware wallet. I also have yet to successfully verify the signature of the Electrum installer for macOS, so I don't trust it.

My worry with buying a hardware wallet (e.g. from Ledger or Trezor) is in the risk of it being damaged or lost. I'll have the seed phrase, but I'm reading that [a seed phrase generated by one hardware wallet may not work in another](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9q4d0p/does_btc_seed_phrase_from_one_wallet_work_on_all/). So now I feel like I'm relying on the company to stay in business and continue offering a hardware wallet compatible with my seed phrase.

(I actually joined reddit to learn more about Bitcoin/Crypto and was amazed at the wealth of knowledge!)

I am at the point where I no longer have faith in any fiat and believe that crypto (Bitcoin specifically IMO) is the future of currency.

I have been thinking recently about what this post-fiat world would look like and how society could change/adapt to it and would be interested in hearing some other opinions.

The way I see it, currently the world is operating on fiat, with banks and governments producing more/less as they feel needed.

Currently our society works off debt, you get a student loan, a mortgage, personal loan etc.

My question is: how will future ‘banks’ or lending operate? At the moment if you want a house - you get a mortgage, will this still be the case in a post fiat world? If so how will this lending work? 

I have thought about an agreed amount to be paid back for example: the ‘bank’ gives you 0.01BTC to buy a house and eventually you payback 0.015BTC. But from my eyes that would just end in governments, ‘banks’, whales etc still having the power to control just without printing money.

Again sorry if this breaks any rules or is a foolish concept, I am still learning and would love some other insights that could make me understand more, are there any other post-fiat concerns? Or am I just too close minded to even think of another way of doing things?

Can you last one more decade with petro going to all time highs extractions and not slowing down? Watching big companies trading carbon credits and creating new ways to not pay taxes? And we getting eating away by inflation with a intransparent system backed by murder drones?

I don't and the energy fud is real, it is causes fear, uncertainty and doubt to a lot of people and it will continue that way until we don't say out loud our opinion on mining without purpose.

Come on....a multi-millionaire gets HUGE amounts of $, much of it usable for his own personal benefit and that of his family, while so many people including people like my tenants will experience inflation from it, which I've had to personally witness as I've had to raise rents in order to just keep up with my own rising costs as a small landlord.  

So, after witnessing all of this play out firsthand over the past couple years, and just seething at how utterly wrongful it all is, I sold a couple houses as the eviction moratorium had put me in a cash crunch and a tenant was using it to beat me for free rent.  And I began looking for something, anything, which can provide a pathway to fairness and making these horribly wrongful things set right.  And at first I found gold and silver and really put some $ into those.  But I'd owned a little gold and silver for the past decade, ever since the Great Financial Crisis, and honestly they just weren't very lively or fun to follow!  Bought my first gold at $1,250 in 2010, and it literally just about did NOTHING for the next decade.  Some ups and downs but all in all not much going.  

I'd used Bitcoin in small amounts in the past years in order to fund my online sports betting account, as it's international and would cause problems with the debit card.  But I'd otherwise always heard Bitcoin associated with negatives, the Silk Road and drugs, heard it was a hoax, loved Peter Schiff and really trusted his podcasts and believed it had no intrinsic value and therefore was worthless, blah blah blah.  Peter had been right on the housing market collapse and frankly I trusted him.  Somewhere around February this past year, I actually took the time to learn more about Bitcoin.  I did not even know that there was a hard limit to the supply of Bitcoin until less than a year ago!  And here I'd used it for years in small transactions with my bookie.  

So, long story short, after learning about the 21 million limit, about the network a little, and considering it's positives, I decided to get into it.  At first I was naive enough to hold it on a couple exchanges and thought that would work well.  But the more I read about it and learned about it, the MORE I LOVED IT!!!  It's like finding Jesus!!!!  I know that sounds kind of silly, but it's like wow.  Eventually I had the sense to get my own hardware wallet, though I've still got the gold/silver.

I'm new to paper wallet sweeps and it's been pretty nerve-racking (this coming from someone that stresses even more typical, straightforward copy-paste transfers).


So far I've learned: a.) I want to do a **sweep** rather than an import. b.) The paper wallets are P2PKH, and I wanted to go with nested wallets with the Trezor. c.) The private keys start with ""K"" or ""L"", so I wouldnt need to do a private key decrypt step (I think? Please correct me if that's wrong).



1. When installing Electrum, how do I confirm the ""GPG"", ""hologram"", ""fingerprint"", ""thumbprint"", etc? Sites mention to verify those with the one you install, but where do you find the 'code-things' to match against your install? Can I use a notepad to check these, or is a 3rd party validator really necessary?

2. Electrum's site mentions that anti-virus software will give false positives... not exactly comforting to hear: should I still keep all of the softwares enabled? Is there something I can do during the question #1 process to keep the antiviruses running without hindering or screwing up the sweeps in any possible ways?

3. Can I keep my computer offline after I install Electrum to do the sweeps themselves? 

4. My plan is to uninstall Electrum after having everything successfully moved to my Trezor. Any other things I need to be aware about? Do I need to move my 'Electrum-with-Trezor' wallet to a 'Trezor-Suite-only' wallet before doing something like that?


5. **Perhaps my BIGGEST question, and getting to this thread's title:** I cant find it now but read that you can't use Electrum to do multiple rounds of paper wallet sweeps, I think. It's hazy, but with later rounds you might have to clear/delete all your connections and start over again, or something like that? Appreciate any insight/experience on this part, as I'd hate to get confident with the first round going smooth, only to find I screw up the time it matters most due to overlooking a new additional step.


It might be more straightforward than I'm making it out to be, but it currently feels like studying for an important final exam using a textbook in a not-too-familiar language.

I’m in the U.K. for clarity around what I’m discussing.

Let’s say you’re a long hodler and have some nice unrealised gains. Let’s say that you have enough that if you were to sell, and cash it out, you would have tax implications because it is above the capital gains limit.

My understanding is that tax implications must be considered on every single transaction made, so you need to know your own baseline for when you do tax reports.

What is stopping someone, who has moderate unrealised gains, to sell enough btc that would put them up to, but not over, the capital gains limit, and then buy back into btc moments later?

You realised the gains. You’re under the capital gains limit (assuming that you don’t trade or do anything else other that holding), and you decided you want to hold onto btc afterall so that’s why you bought back in.

So in theory, you now have a new baseline for any future gains, as the tax has already been “realised”, but because you were under the capital gains you didn’t actually pay anything.

Of course, this would imply that you have a decent amount of unrealised gains, so any remaining btc you didn’t realise you would have to keep track of in the future.

But surely, for a long term holder, this could be a good way to slowly ease the tax burden?

Miners will have to resort to transaction fees  as incentive for mining. Bitcoin community will ultimately agree to raise Bitcoin cap and inflation will become normalized for Bitcoin. This will solve high transaction fee issue but will lead to a slippery slope. 

Recently, I’ve been researching other block chains, particularly how they are able to reward miners and users. I came across Steemit, which is in the STEEM blockchain. Steemit is interesting because they reward users for posting and curating content that receive a lot of support (upvotes, comments, etc…). They are able to pay the users the participate by inflating their own token. 

This got me thinking about Bitcoin and what will happen when Bitcoin inflates to its limit of 21 million. When it reaches its supply limit, miners will stop receiving block rewards for mining transaction blocks which is their main incentive for mining and keeping the validity of the blockchain. Instead of block rewards, miners will mostly rely on transaction fees. 

This is when I believe we run into a problem. This is because historically humans have a strong distaste for fees especially with simple actions on the Internet. If we want Bitcoin to become a global currency that is used for primarily every transaction, having fees is an easy way to deter new people from adopting Bitcoin as their main currency. 

I think instinctively, adopters of Bitcoin will immediately turn to raising Bitcoins supply cap (probably by 2x) to solve this issue. Which will decrease the value of Bitcoin in circulation, but will increase incentives for miners and increase transactions since there will be less or no fees. Ultimately, this creates a new precedent that the infrastructure of Bitcoin can be changed whenever a problem arises, especially in regards to inflation. Additionally, this puts us in a similar situation as the US Government as they make efforts to inflate their own fiat currency without seeing any issue with it. I believe this will be a slippery slope if this occurs and eventually Bitcoin’s principles that made it appealing in the first place will erode. 

One solution to this problem will be to make the amount of power used to mine blocks significantly lower as that will incentivize miners to mine blocks with lowers transaction fees.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect to catch some grief for being a newb but hopefully I get some good advice too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just over a month I knew nothing about Crypto and was only just starting to read about how the stock market works. I came across a co worker who is only like 18 years old and had invested around 30k into both stocks and crypto. I'm 30 + and always just assumed the stock market shit was for rich old white dudes with old money. And thought crypto was dangerous and only an underground thing. I was kicking myself when this kid told me he had doubled his net worth with this. He emphasized crypto but I still only payed attention to the stocks part. Kept reading up on how it works.

Then comes along my brother in law who is only talking about crypto and this dude is good with money so I couldn't brush it off. I've been looking into if for a while know and have come to believe Bitcoin is the best one.

 I only have like $30-$40 bucks in so far but plan to load up $100 and slowly buy more when it dips into to red. Kind of like DCA just buying when its low. I can't convince my fiance to let me put a chunk of our savings in at this time so I'm hoping to turn $100 into $200 so I can prove to her it works and that we are missing out.

 I just need to get started I know it will work. We've busted our asses long enough and it is time to make some money work for us and stop being slaves to the rigged system!

I'm know I'm suffering FOMO but I'm just trying to save $20 here $20 there and put in what ever I can. 

Have any of you all started like me? What should I be doing? Put in some when I can or build up more and buy all at once? 

What are some good things to read or watch?

There is a big danger that a few people talk about. If a government (especially large ones like USA and China) decides to destroy Bitcoin at all cost, they can easily do a 51 attack and nothing can stop them.

Let's say China government decided to destroy Bitcoin.

\-According to a source, it'd cost $3 billion to buy enough ASIC machines for an 51 attack. This is a funny amount for a government. And China, with its authoritarian regime and abundant land &amp; electronics &amp; power, can easily produce enough mining machines in government factories.

\- They secretly create a super big mining farm, with more hashrate then current entire hashrate, they can use government sponsored construction and energy which makes things easier.

\- They turn on the mining rig. Now they control more than 50+ % of the Bitcoin hashrate. They can do all malicious things of 51 attacking, such as double spending.

\- They don't have to care about profit from the double spent Bitcoins they're generating. All they care is destroying Bitcoin, which has became a huge concern for governments at the moment.

\- They will keep destroying the network as much as they can with the never ending 51 attack.

\- This will be huge earthquake for Bitcoin, with a potential 90% price drop in days. All other cryptocurrencies will be wrecked as well. Everyone will lose confidence to cryptos and panic sell ASAP.

\- As Bitcoin gets wrecked, it won't be profitable to continue mining for other miners around the world. Legit miners will turn off their rigs and the legit hashrate will drop. This makes it even easier for China to maintain the 51 attack.

This will end up in a disaster for Bitcoin and all cryptocurrenies with an unbelivable loss in value and confidence. Even after the attack, nothing will be the same. People will never trust Bitcoin again as the same attack can happen at anytime.

For us all the options to save our money is very bad, 

Here is the most common ways to save/invest your money and why they are bad:

1- Saving in national currency in banks (national currency loses a great amount of their value yearly and banks can run out of money or national currency loses all its values).

2- Saving in dollars in banks (Banks can go bankrupt or deny you from withdrawing your money, or even force you to withdraw your money in national currency like what happened in Lebanon and lose 50% of their values, or can simply tell you there is not enough dollars to withdraw) [Lebanese banks dollar withdrawal rate at 3,000 pounds, half official peg](https://english.alarabiya.net/business/economy/2020/04/27/Lebanese-bank-set-dollar-withdrawal-exchange-rate-at-3-000-pounds-half-official-peg).

3- Saving in gold/dollar/national currency at home (you can easily get robbed).

4- Saving money in real state is not safe since coups and revolutions are a bit common in our countries and you might need to take your family and flee the country in a day.

Also try to withdraw your money from banks, or take your hidden gold from home in case of a revolution or a coup to flee the country.

I used to be worried all the time about where to save my hard earned money, and where to invest them, till I found out about bitcoin and went down the rabbit hole a couple of years ago, I became so fascinated by it and started investing all my money in it, and spending from my saving bank account.

We communicate ideas, ideals, gossip and productive collaboration. We do this using language. Specifically using both vernacular and mathematics, the alphabet and numerals.

We also have the need to communicate value, for example favours owed and value attributed, and we do this by assigning value to something that we own that can then be transferred to another person. Once upon a time humans used mathematics to do this, simply by tallying lines carved on cave walls representing debts owned and value paid. But beyond a group of 20 cave men this system broke down requiring primitive objects and barter to be used instead.

For thousands of years this was gold, then it was paper, then bank ledgers. Gold is not a language it is a primitive tool used in place of a language, but it was needed because language could not hold value itself when requiring collaboration over distance and between different groups. Bank ledgers were also poor substitutes for a language as they were not universally recognised systems of communication, they are segregated closed controlled censored and corrupted systems of account, not a shared language.

Then we arrive at bitcoin. Bitcoin is pure math. Bitcoin is pure language. Bitcoin takes the human base layer of language which is universally recognised mathematics and turns it into a protocol that we as humans can then subjectively assign value to. This mathematical protocol can then be used as a language of value communication.

Bitcoin is the first system of money in tens of thousands of years of human history that uses an actual system of language to facilitate the communication of value.

At this point in time the hype is fading away and things are settling down.

For starters, the chivo app still have problems doing transactions (tx) to external wallets like muun or coinomi. Tx between chivo wallets are fine, although they use a btc L1 QR code, the transactions are instant and without any issue, so it’s logic to assume chivo doesn’t use the btc blockchain at all.

I personally think chivo app is becoming something similar to a bank app, you can send and receive money, it has 0 fees between the same app, you contact customer support for any issues, and it’s a pain in the ass to make transaction to other banks (external wallets)…

Many of you might say this is just the beginning and that things will change…and you’re probably right, I also hope the development of btc as currency take a step forward.

Moreover, I imagine what many of you are thinking, *why do you need to use chivo? Just use another wallet.*

Yes, I can use other LN wallets, however the main issue is the fee, a $0.50 coke can become $1.50, all of you already know how fees work. So, by using chivo app you omit paying fees and the transaction is instant…

The most used wallets aside chivo are muun and wallet of Satoshi, only on the beach and nearby places you might find bitcoin beach wallet. Many people asked me about strike, but no one really use it, it requires your ID to register aside other personal information, you also can´t send less than $5 so…it’s not a wallet for daily use.

Some people also asked about the implementation of other crypto currencies, there are some interesting projects like nano but as long the coin doesn´t show any advantage in a daily use I find it harder to succeed.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably the big news as for today is bitcoin city, since I don´t have more information than what Bukele explain I’ll only share what people is saying…

As always, there are many who thinks this will help develop the country attracting investors and foreigners, I think this is true. On the other hand, there’s also people who claim the country need investment in areas like education, security and so on rather than building btc city which probably only benefit a small group of people…I also think this is true.

El Salvador needs to improve in many ways, government needs to plan in short and long term. There´s no good or wrong answer at the moment, after all you do what you can and what you think will bring the best outcome.

Fun fact, the image of bitcoin city is actually a stock image with a volcano over it…this became trendy in social media days ago.

Probably the most eye-catching feature is the tax exemption, bitcoin city seems to be a haven for local and foreign investors, I personally think Salvadoran government is saying “I don’t care how you get the bitcoin…just come”.

*Will btc city became a crypto version of Las Vegas? What are your thoughts?* Leave your comments below!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There’re also some people who asked me about land and the safest locations in my country, it´s hard to answer in detail to everyone so I will create a post around Friday titled

**“Almost everything you need to know to buy land in El Salvador and not dying (literally) in the process”**

With such a catchy title it will be difficult to miss it….

I will try to summarize the most relevant information about my country geography and social context. There are many misconceptions about how dangerous El Salvador is. I´ll also give you some insights about real state, I wonder if anyone is interested where btc city will be built.

As always, I’ll try to answer all your questions.",3614535,I'm from El Salvador...UPDATE 5,0,1.0,2021-11-29 19:49:44,NEGATIVE,0.6748112440109253

I registered an account in a centralized exchange (CEX) and in a private wallet, bought a small amount of BTC and ETH, and made some transactions. I then found that the gas fee was tooooo expensive and sometimes it took a percentage of 10 of my total assets. So when I knew that bitcoin cash (BCH) aims to be a peer to peer electronic cash with the feature of high throughput, extremely low gas fee, and decentralization, I got excited. Since then, I bought and saved some BCH every month as an investment.

The side chain of BCH – smartBCH was launched in Aug and I created an account according to the tutorial from a volunteer in BCH community ([https://brucelee.cash/](https://brucelee.cash/)). I was new to DeFi and made my first transaction in late Sep (transaction fee \~$0.1). I swapped some EBEN and staked in the BCH-EBEN farm on BenSwap. The APR was over 1100% at that time. I also swapped the meme coin – CATS. Unfortunately, when the price of the tokens went down, I found that I lost 50% of my BCH. I was very upset…

I realized I need to learn more about the projects and do more research. I removed the liquidity and swapped all tokens back to BCH. At that time, I looked through the website of the projects, joined the telegram group and followed the official twitter to track the updates, and talked actively with the experienced DeFi users. When I noticed that the price of EBEN was lower, I thought it may be a good opportunity. I bought the dip and held, and when the price pumped, I got my capital back. Haha\~

Since middle Oct, it was announced that EBEN would be listed on many platforms and CEXes, and that the NFT market and listing of CATS were under schedule. I kept buying and today, my asset has already been doubled (over four times of the lowest).

I sincerely thank smartBCH and people in the community were really nice. Whenever I had a problem, they were here and happy to assist. In addition, there are many fantastic and generous airdrops. I received around 300 EBEN when it was listing on CoinW and it is currently worth over $300. Three days ago, I received an airdrop of DAO token based on a decentralized experiment on smarBCH. It pumped over 30 times in three days and became more and more popular.

SmartBCH is amazing and join us to make a fantastic journey!

Should Banks Be More Open To Cryptocurrencies?

The jury is still out on cryptocurrency. In the first several years following the inception of Bitcoin, banks had little to say about them. More recently, however, as cryptocurrencies have come to regularly dominate the news agenda and have become of interest to a much wider consumer audience, banks have had to decide where they stand.

**Do you know that you can earn so much more on cryptocurrency during this current fluctuations around Bitcoin and the likes?** [CRYPTOHODLERFX](https://www.cryptohodlerfx.com) **is the answer!!! . I got to know more about** [CRYPTOHODLERFX](https://www.cryptohodlerfx.com) **during my searches on how to earn more on my Cryptocurrency and i haVe never had any regret dealing with them so far. I just decide to share this with you because i know i am not the only one who was affected with this cryptocurrency fluctuations.**

The risks associated with cryptocurrencies have been well documented. Their dramatic volatility is what sets cryptocurrencies apart from any other currency or asset as an investment. As volatility is one of the primary risks for banks, it’s understandable why many aren’t allowing their customers to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies in the hope their investment would appreciate in value. The risk for the banks is that if their customers were to see a drop in value of their currency, they could be unable to pay the bank back for the credit or for outstanding loans.

Banks are also citing security as another reason for their reluctance to embrace cryptocurrencies. Since cryptocurrencies have gone mainstream, there has been a string of high-profile cases in which customers have lost their currency in widespread hacking attacks. Other allegations have claimed that the anonymity that cryptocurrencies afford the user is facilitating their involvement in money laundering and fraudulent schemes.

It is easy to see why banks are reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies with such a high number of potential challenges but there is a prospective solution to these types of problems: regulation. Last month the UK’s Treasury Committee described the crypto-landscape as a ‘Wild West’ in desperate need of regulation, but also suggested that such regulations could position the UK as a hub for cryptocurrency trading and development. Regulation would remedy many of the issues that banks are currently facing, encouraging safe development of the crypto-space to the mutual benefit of consumers and institutions.

Cyber-attacks where users have lost currency have occurred when funds are held by centralized exchanges, not by the individual owners themselves. The imposition of legislation around cryptocurrency storage is likely to encourage education among crypto-owners about the safest and more secure way to store digital assets",3616597,Should banks be interested In cryptocurrency?,0,1.0,2021-11-30 10:21:41,NEGATIVE,0.9919439554214478

Anyone playing payroll-in-bitcoin will HAVE to spend bitcoin, even spending it on pizza that may represent half a billion dollars in ""opportunity costs"".  But here's why payroll-in-bitcoin is good, even if you buy a pizza from time to time.

1. Converting the full paycheck to bitcoin gives you the maximum exposure to up-ticks
2. Forces you to have a ""savers"" mind instead of focusing on hookers, coke and lambos.
3. Allows you to support companies accepting bitcoin at the counter
4. Allows you to support companies offering bitcoin credit cards or gift certs.
5. Puts money in ""savings"" by default
6. Forces you to budget your life so you can time your USD conversions for bills.

Obviously most of these come with a mirrored downside

1. Maximum exposure to price drops
2. You loose 2% (or more) on fees at exchanges or BTC-card companies
3. Things might be sketchy if your stuck in a rural where BTC conversion may be hard

A lot of the fees can be mitigated if you use some heavy OCD budgeting.  If you know exactly what day the electricity is due and have good estimates you can do your USD conversion on an exchange instead of on a BTC-credit card or other high-fee method.

I'll phrase it a different way.  I have a seed phrase.  The hacker is going to try to brute force all kinds of different attached pass phrases to try and find the funds.  1, 12, 123, Password, Passw0rd!, qwerty, etc.

Most wallets will only look in the first 20-30 addresses of a seed phrase for funds.  If they find none in the first 20-30, the wallet software tells the user it has a 0 balance.

An experienced hacker may look deeper than 20-30 addresses to try and find funds.

How many addresses deep into a seed phrase would take too much time/effort on behalf of the hacker to look in every possible passphrase combination of the seed phrase?

And if they do, labeling won't come across either)

Here are a few ways, some good, and some bad, to use BIP39 in conjunction with Bitcoin-Core.  You should note that the generation of these BIP39 seeds is done outside of Bitcoin-Core so should be thought of as insecure as a general rule.  I provide a way to do it in Electrum on tails, so that may help.

BIP39 is a simple way to encode a secret into a mnemonic.  This is useful for memorization and archiving.  The BIP39 process converts this mnemonic + passphrase combination into a seed used in BIP32, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84 and BIP86.

Bitcoin Core supports a variety of wallets, but a simple classification of them would be ""Legacy"" (P2PKH), ""Legacy Segwit"" (P2SH-P2WPKH), ""Native Segwit"" (P2WPKH) and ""Taproot"" (P2TR).  And these 4 wallet types are supported by two formats, ""Conventional"" (Berkley-DB) and ""Descriptor"" (SQLite DB).  Descriptor wallets can support all 4 types, and Conventional wallets do not support Taproot.  Unless you run Bitcoin-Core in ""nowallet"" mode, you are defaulted with a Native-Segwit conventional wallet.

Descriptor wallets use a BIP32-Extended-Privte-Key (tprv).  BIP39 is well formed to feed secrets into BIP32, so pairing BIP39 and BIP32 is pretty easy.  Conventional wallets, on the other-hand, require a 128-bit seed called ""hdseed"" in WIF encoding.  This is the same format that bitcoin private keys are in.  Unfortunately BIP39 usually outputs a 512-bit seed not a 128-bit seed.  So a bit of ""creativity"" is required.  ""Creativity"" is a curse word in standards and cryptography so my creative approaches are the ""bad-kind"".

So here are three ways you can use 12-word seeds for simple backup in Bitcoin-Core:

1. Pair a [HW wallet](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/qwdie9/christmas_hardware_wallet_nov_2021_pricelist/
) to Bitcoin-Core, since most already work on BIP39
2. Make a [descriptor wallet](
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md
), since you can easily go from BIP39 to BIP32
3. Use a ""creative"" approach to cherry-pick a WIF from a BIP39 derivation

### \#1 - Pairing with HW wallet

This is usually done with [HWI](
https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI
).  Some people have forked the code and used it in a nice skinned GUI, but I can't recall the name.  Maybe someone can post it here.  I did it all through command-line and did a fairly [detailed writeup](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/izmi2w/windows_linux_guide_to_using_trezor_with_bitcoin/
).  It's pretty easy, just hard to guess the skillset of the reader.

### \#2 - Make a descriptor wallet

Descriptor wallets are all pretty straightforward.  You simply use BIP39 to make a 512-bit seed, and use it with BIP32 to create a tprv.  I have a fairly detailed writeup on it for Taproot](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/r37ky5/howto_create_and_use_a_taproot_wallet_on_testnet/
).

### \#3 - ""Creative"" cherry-picked WIF

This will not cover Taproot since those wallets must be descriptor wallets currently.  As I remind you that creativity is bad, but here's the basic approach.  Simply create a traditional BIP39 wallet and use the ""first"" address at the standard derivations for legacy (`m/44'/1'/0'/0/0`), legacy-segwit (`m/49'/1'/0'/0/0`), and native-segwit  (`m/84'/1'/0'/0/0`) specs.  Here's what you will need to do:

1. Perform steps [I, II, and III](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/r37ky5/howto_create_and_use_a_taproot_wallet_on_testnet/
) my taproot writeup
2. Replace ""bech32m"" in step III with ""legacy"", ""p2sh-segwit"", or ""bech32"" as needed
3. Perform step [IV.1, IV.2, IV.3](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/r37ky5/howto_create_and_use_a_taproot_wallet_on_testnet/
)
4. On [Ian's site](
https://iancoleman.io/bip39/
), pick tab ""BIP44"", ""BIP49"", or ""BIP84"" for legacy, legacy-segwit, or native-segwit
5. Copy the the first private key WIF for each tab as your hdseed
6. In Bitcoin-Core, choose ""Create Wallet"" from the ""File"" menu
7. Select ""Make Blank Wallet"", name and create your wallet
8. Open the Bitcoin-core console and ensure the wallet selector is on your wallet
9. Run the `sethdseed true ""__WIF__""` replacing ""__WIF__"" with the WIF from step \#5

### Simpler Shortcut

Most of this can be done pretty simply in python, and [here are 40 lines](https://github.com/brianddk/reddit/blob/master/python/hdseed.py) to do it, but running python code to make private keys is sketchy.  To this point, I wrote this to work against the electrum libraries and can be run inside the electrum wallet directly.  And electrum is pre-installed in tails, so perhaps that is simpler for you, IDK.  But only run this script if you understand the 40 lines being run.  The point is to put you more at ease, not less at ease.

1. Download the script to `C:\Windows\Temp\hdseed.py` (or wherever)
2. Review the 40 lines and ensure you understand enough to decide if it is safe
3. Boot tails and launch Electrum on Testnet (not mainnet)
4. Copy the script to tails (`/tmp/hdseed.py`)
5. In Electrum open the console
6. In the Electrum console run the command below:

    with open(""/tmp/hdseed.py"") as f: exec(f.read())

You should get a seed mnemonic, a `tprv` for descriptor wallets, and three hdseeds for conventional wallets.",3615988,[How-To] Ways to use 12 word seeds (BIP39) in Bitcoin Core v22.0 (testnet),0,1.0,2021-11-30 05:40:04,POSITIVE,0.6329987049102783

I started this fundraiser shortly after getting a message from the veterinarian saying he would need to have an ultrasound and possibly surgery as he was evacuating a lot of blood despite the treatment.

But let me give a little background to my understanding, and please, poke holes in it. I'm deeply curious about this, and haven't been able to find a straight forward answer online (at least, I don't think).

Past transactions can't be tampered with because of the distributed ledger (blockchain). If someone were to tamper with a past transaction, it would easily be rejected since a copy of the ledger is distributed across a huge network of computers. So to successfully do this, a 51% attack would be necessary.

New transactions (as in someone trying to attach a new transaction to the end of the blockchain rather than tamper with old transactions) can't be faked because of the PoW system. If I've understood correctly, this would not be possible because the sheer amount of work it would take to find the target hash would be far too difficult for a single user or group to do. Although due to the randomness of the PoW system, it does appear it would be possible for a single user to find the target hash, it would just take an extreme amount of luck and wouldn't scale well.

This is something that should be noted, as we are living in a more uncertain world than we have ever seen in the year 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the current monetary and financial system established in August 1971 by Richard Nixon suffers from seven deadly sins that will lead to its collapse, Bitcoin is intended to be our antidote for a better future world for the many.

At the heart of the Bitcoin system is a protocol that gives you essential guarantees. You can rely on these guarantees to preserve the fruits of your labor because you know that they cannot be violated by a simple arbitrary decision of a few humans. This is the opposite of what happens in the current monetary and financial system, whose original sin is the absolute power of money creation given to central bankers.

Here are the 10 guarantees that Bitcoin gives you and that make all the difference:

1. There will never be more than 21 million BTC in circulation
2. 10 minutes delay on average between the issuance of each block of transactions
3. An adjustment of the mining difficulty of the Bitcoin network every 2,016 mined blocks
4. A decrease in the reward given to miners for every 210,000 blocks issued
5. A consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work
6. Bitcoin is the most secure decentralized network in the world
7. A permanently available network (Uptime &gt; 99.985% since Bitcoin creation)
8. A never hacked network
9. The data of the Bitcoin Blockchain is immutable
10. The Bitcoin code is open source

In an uncertain world, Bitcoin is your best hedge against uncertainty. The stability of the Bitcoin protocol gives you certainty. You are guaranteed to have the world’s most secure decentralized network to store the fruits of your labor over time in a censor-proof manner.

More and more users understand the value represented by these Bitcoin invariants. This clearly explains why the adoption of Bitcoin is accelerating, but also why companies like MicroStrategy have decided to make Bitcoin their primary treasury reserve asset since the summer of 2020.

The next time someone tells you that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, you can reply that the guarantees that Bitcoin gives to its users are the reasons why more and more people will opt for the Bitcoin system in the future and make it more and more valuable.

^(Disclaimer: This guide describes a Windows-10 setup, uses the Testnet network and requires an external tool to generate a BIP32 extended private key \(""xprv"" / ""tprv""\).  If you know a good way to generate a ""tprv"" in v22.0, please let me know.)

With the activation of Taproot, it is likely a good time to get familiar with the taproot addresses and wallets.  Since the surfacing of taproot in the bitcoin-core GUI is still in the early stages, some of this how-to will feel a bit kludgey.  Things will get simpler in subsequent releases I'm sure.

The basic goal of this walkthrough will be to create a Taproot wallet using the descriptor wallet feature and the `bech32m` config option.  This is in no way ""required"", it is simply a way to familiarize yourself with the new features released this year in bitcoin core.

Here are the general steps.  Feel free to skip ahead as needed:
***
### [0] TLDR; This got longer than I intended

1. Install bitcoin v22
2. Launch in testnet
3. Create a new descriptor wallet
4. Use `importdescriptors` to make a Taproot descriptor
5. Profit

If that makes perfect sense, your done, if not, read the detailed steps.

***
### I. Download Bitcoin-Core v22.0

If you are already at version 22.0 or v0.21 you can skip this step.  This will layout the steps for Window-10.  Obviously you shouldn't trust my links, but I'll provide them anyway.  The installer hash should be: ^(`9169989d649937c0f9ebccd3ab088501328aa319fe9e91fc7ea8e8cf0fcccede`)

1. Download [Bitcoin-Core version 22.0 Installer](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/bitcoin-22.0-win64-setup.exe) ^(\([Onion link for UK folks](http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/bitcoin-22.0-win64-setup.exe)\))
2. Download the [v22.0 checksum file](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/SHA256SUMS) ^(\([Onion link for UK folks](http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/SHA256SUMS)\))
3. Download the [v22.0 checksum signature file](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/SHA256SUMS.asc) ^(\([Onion link for UK folks](http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/SHA256SUMS.asc)\))
4. [Verify the installer download](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/#verify-your-download) ^(\([Onion link for UK folks](http://6hasakffvppilxgehrswmffqurlcjjjhd76jgvaqmsg6ul25s7t3rzyd.onion/en/download/#verify-your-download)\))

***
### II. Install Bitcoin-Core v22.0

The Authenticode thumbprint on the installer should be: ^(`47cda868c6e7c97b54963041922cfd283c2c961d`)

1. If this is an upgrade, close any existing copy of bitcoin in execution.
1. Launch `bitcoin-22.0-win64-setup.exe` downloaded previously
2. On the installer UAC verification warning click `Show more details`
3. In the expanded details click `Show information about publisher's certificate`
4. In the certificate page, click the `Details` tab
5. In the details list, click `Thumbprint` near the bottom
6. Verify the Thumbprint matches ^(`47cda868c6e7c97b54963041922cfd283c2c961d`)
7. Close the certificate window and accept the warning to start the install

***
### III. Launch Bitcoin-Core v22.0 on Testnet

We will run and configure on testnet since the coins have no cost.  In step \#5, you will need to add the following lines to the `bitcoin.conf` file:

    test.addresstype=bech32m
    test.changetype=bech32m

1. On the start menu, search or run ""Bitcoin Core (testnet, 64-bit)""
2. Once loaded, select `Options` from the `Settings` menu
3. Click `Open Configuration File` and accept the warning
4. A text editor should open with a blank file called `bitcoin.conf`.
5. In the `bitcoin.conf` file, add the two lines mentioned above, save, and close the file
6. Exit, close and and restart ""Bitcoin Core (testnet, 64-bit)""

If you are stuck downloading testnet blocks, you can still proceed through step `IV` and step `V`

***
### IV. Generate a testnet `tprv` to use in Bitcoin Core v22.0

You can make a `tprv` any way you want, this is one of the easier ways I know of. 
 For this section, open a blank text file and copy the following three lines to it, we will edit it as we progress.

    your_mnemonic: __mnemo__
    getdescriptorinfo ""tr(__tprv__/86'/1'/0'/0/*)""
    importdescriptors ""[{\""desc\"":\""tr(__tprv__/86'/1'/0'/0/*)#__chksum__\"",\""active\"":true,\""timestamp\"":\""now\"",\""range\"":[0,1000],\""next_index\"":1}]""

1. Go to [Ian's BIP39 site](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)
2. Change the ""Words"" selection from `15` to `12` and click `Generate`
3. Change the ""Coin"" selector to `BTC - Bitcoin Testnet`
4. In your text file replace `__mnemo__` with the text in ""BIP39 Mnemonic"" 
5. In your text file replace both instances of `__tprv__` with the text in ""BIP32 Root Key""

***
### V. Create a Taproot Wallet

We will make one final edit to your text file so keep it open...

1. Back in Bitcoin-Core, pick `Create Wallet` from the `File` menu
2. Name your wallet `descwallet`
3. Select the ""Make Blank Wallet"" checkbox
4. Also, select the ""Make Descriptor Wallet"" checkbox
5. Click `Create`
6. Pick `Console` from the `Window` menu
7. At the top of the console window, set the wallet selector to `descwallet`
8. From your text file copy the completed `getdescriptorinfo` command (second line) and paste it in the console (hit enter)
9. You'll get an 8 character checksum from the command, use it to replace the `__chksum__` tag in your text file
10. From your text file copy the completed `importdescriptors` command (third line) and paste it in the console (hit enter)
11. If you get a `""success"": true` response, you can close your console window.

For reference, your final `importdescriptors` command should look something like this, though the `__tprv__`, and `__chksum__` fields will be different, obviously.

    importdescriptors ""[{\""desc\"":\""tr(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPdD3rvZEHuMSXTFGG399p6rMxnqyqFnDuNbMLc7xCfLUryJnLqYUHUiRFJKhDpGXJyz5nVsgkidh65PDC5AVWoNEKA2XLSLf/86'/1'/0'/0/*)#czml648s\"",\""active\"":true,\""timestamp\"":\""now\"",\""range\"":[0,1000],\""next_index\"":1}]""

***
### VI. Get some Testnet coins from a faucet

You will need to have completed your testnet block download, so if it is still downloading, go to bed and resume this in the morning.  If you don't like sketchy faucet sites, just post a testnet-bech32 or testnet-bech32m address and maybe someone on thread will send you some.
 
1. From the main Bitcoin-core wallet screen, set the wallet selector (in top right) to `descwallet`
2. Click the `Receive` tab on the mail wallet screen
3. Make sure to ***UNCHECK*** `Generate native segwit (Bech32) address`
4. Click `Create new receiving address` to get a taproot bech32m address (starts with `tb1p`)
5. Visit `https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/` and answer the captcha (hint: the ""plus"" sign often looks like ""x"")
6. Use the `tb1p` address you just generated to receive coins from the faucet

***
### Conclusion

This was as thorough and simple an explanation as I could manage for using the `importdescriptors` command to make a Taproot wallet.  Ultimately you will likely want to generate some change-addresses and possibly do a `keypoolrefill`, but if you got this far you can likely figure the rest out.

So, after decades of what I would describe as slow torture, seeing El Salvador (ES from now on) become what it still is for most of the world, for an expat living in North America but always hoping to maybe one day go back and do something good. It’s hard to describe. [The past presidents](https://insightcrime.org/news/brief/three-el-salvador-presidents-investigated-corruption/) might give you a good idea of what someone living abroad, one of the [“dreamers”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act) if you will.  

Fast-forward to today and ES is in the news and the feel from most family and friends whom I’ve kept in touch is one of hope and excitement. Then there’s reddit and the internet. Like many of you here, I believe that bitcoin and more specifically crypto as a whole is the future. So, imagine the excitement at seeing all the good things happening in ES. Personally, I’ve been into crypto since 2017, so [the Bitcoin thing,](https://globalnews.ca/news/8171521/el-salvador-adopts-bitcoin-legal-tender/) for me, was the cherry on top. I told many people I talked to that the tourism alone from the news would be great for the country, and it has been.  

Now if I go over to r/elsalvador, and I base myself from what I’ve read since around the time the new president was elected, it’s not going well.  In fact, some outlets even claim he’s a dictator, an oppressor and there’s an ulterior motive behind all this. While I don’t blindly follow the guy since he [has done some wild shit](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/804407503/troops-occupy-el-salvadors-legislature-to-back-president-s-crime-package) I really don’t think helps his image I’ve seen, read and heard about changes, actual changes. If I base myself from what I’ve seen, there’s stuff moving down there, things are alive, tourists and investors are curious. I was there in 2019 not long after he won. I was there to visit family and take my kids to see where their old man was from. I was not there for any other reason than to vacation and see if there were any opportunities to invest in something worthwhile. I didn’t get a single negative comment at that time, yet the media, governments, reddit (outside r/bitcoin) were painting him as a bad dude all around.  

So, this time, I’m going there with a bit of a mission, I want to know and see for myself and speak to everyone that will give their opinion. 

I’ve already set up a few meetings with people from different walks of life, doctors and vendors on the street. Factory workers and business owners, students and retired people. I really want to ask for their honest opinion and report back, because the stuff I read here are very many uneducated guesses, misinformed opinions, and angry people. It’s killing me, reading all kinds of different things everywhere. I see so many foreigners posting videos and praising different things, this can’t all be fake, can it? I see people taking bitcoin as payment on street corners, new developments, [international competitions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWDH6HFfgV0) So, when I see people online saying this is not bringing anything beneficial, it blows my mind and either I’m blind and don’t understand or this is just another [move from higher powers to control crypto](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/business/banks-crypto-bitcoin.html) growth.

The descriptors fields clearly show the `tpubs`, and there may be private keys in the `*spk` fields.  But in order to do BIP32 derivations, you need both a private key and a chain-code.

I can't seem to create the `tprvs` from the `tpubs`, even given private keys.  I've looked through the code at [commit 4018e23](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/4018e23/src), and have some vague ideas on how it is constructed, but can't quite seem to figure out which fields hold either a private key and chain-code, or simply a `tprv`.

There is also the possibility that the key value itself is actually encrypted at rest in the database, but I had assumed that these would use the `walletdescriptorckey` field for `crypted-key` as opposed to the `walletdescriptorkey` fields.  Notice my dump only contains `*rkey` fields and no `rckey` fields.

I realize that the next release will expose the `tprv` in the future `listdescriptors` command, but I was trying to figure out how [PR#21500](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21500) did it.

The code to create the SQL dump file is... essentially:

    from sqlite_utils import Database

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
        db=Database(""wallet.dat"")
        for row in db['main'].rows:
            key = fmt_key(row['key'])
            value = fmt_key(row['value'])
            
            pref = ""{wallet.dat}.main.""
            print(f""{pref}{{{key}}} = {value}"")

This is about the most basic and easiest wallet system to use right?   


How do you guys feel about online storage of your seed phrases? Say I put my seeds in a text file. I double zip file it up with password protection and email it to a gmail address. That's 3 layers of passwords/security someone has to get thru to access the keys. Its your Google Account which will flag unfamiliar ip's and devices. Then someone would have to actually find the email, brute force the password to zip files. To even add on to this, you could split the seed phrases into two separate files and force like 4+ passwords to extract the seeds.

I will jump right into my game plan and I would love it if you would critique me and help me better understand a better way of investing into Bitcoin.

From what I understand, the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140. When we reach that point (I will be dead), I’ve read that some people believe 1 single Bitcoin will be worth anywhere from 10 Million a coin to 20 million a coin. Therefore, while we have seen “parabolic” ( @ bitboy ) gains over the last couple years, there is still a ton of room for growth. Like a lot a lot.

Here is my game-plan: 3 months ago I started DCAing into Bitcoin $100 a month. My side hustle is wedding videography, which as you probably know, makes me a lot of cash on the side. I plan to add an additional $300 from each wedding every year until I’m 30 years old (I am 22). I shoot 8-15 weddings a year. Therefore, this puts my annual contributions to roughly $4000. Here is where I need advice: I plan on stopping my contributions into Bitcoin when I am 30. The reason being is that I would love to contribute more to my pension plan and my future kids college fund. Would you let your Bitcoin investment sit for 25+ years without adding more $?Would the return be good enough to retire on by 55-60 years old? Should I diversify more? Is this even a good game plan?

Since it was $6 bitcoin has risen 10,000 times (1 million percent) to reach $60,000.

If you take gold from $180 per ounce (bitcoins market cap equivalent) and divide it by 10,000 it gives you the btc market cap equivelant price of gold per ounce if bitcoin were $6.

Luckily my parents are the best, they don’t mind if I stay with them at all for as long as I need, the only rule is that I start saving for my future.

Now, with my full-time job and a lot less  fixed charges thanks to my parents, I will be able to save around 75% of my salary. Which is, considering I did some math, more than realistic, without forcing me to stop doing some fun stuff as well.

Hi guys, I was wondering if someone could help me understand a little more about the PoW consensus used by Bitcoin and the energy required to keep it running.

From my understanding, the PoW algorithm developed by Satoshi is similar to the way gold is mined, in the sense that money is fundamentally a storage medium for labour, thus proof of work in the Bitcoin blockchain is comparable to the effort that’s required to dig up and process gold. As miners are financially incentivised to continue securing the network, they will seek to develop and innovate increasingly efficient and cost effective means of expending energy.

I also understand that traditional fiat currency is prone to manipulation and debasement because there is a lack of a PoW consensus - central banks can just infinitely print money without the need to expend any energy or labour. Furthermore, our current economic system rewards those who can export all their labour and energy concerns to the cheapest source. It is more financially incentivising to send your work to countries where the profit margins are highest, which more than often means exporting labour to countries where regulations regarding energy use and carbon emissions are practically nonexistent.

There are increasingly growing demands for bitcoin to drop its PoW consensus due to the “carbon footprint” and energy concerns around it however I can only seem to view a lot of the criticism as disingenuous virtue signalling. These folks usually have no issues with using an economic system that is continuously being debased and simultaneously rewards those with the highest carbon footprint. But expending energy to secure a fixed supply monetary system is too much. Surely, with a combined global effort to switch over to nuclear and renewable resources, we can produce an economic system that will provide massive economic development for society as cost of living will start to naturally fall.

A lot of people also seem to push PoS as the solution and praise ethereum (went back and forth with a few people from r/cc) for its upcoming update to switch over however I do not see this as a positive. Ethereum is highly centralised with a massive premine in its early days. Therefore it is glaringly obvious that the ones who will gain most from proof of stake are the insider venture capitalists and developers who were able to benefit from the premine. 

TLDR - Is someone able to explain if the energy concerns around PoW is just disingenuous FUD or is there a case to be made? Would Bitcoin instead benefit from PoS and what would be the benefits/drawbacks of doing so? Would it even be feasible? Many thanks for reading through all that :)",3573865,Bitcoin - PoW vs PoS and energy trade offs,0,1.0,2021-11-18 12:58:51,NEGATIVE,0.9936657547950745

This is the problem to be solved. When we give governments or central banks or commercial banks or companies control over gold in order to issue gold backed representations like paper money they have always ended up breaking this societal agreement because there is no mechanism enforcing them to correctly manage that responsibility, and there are always incorrect yet believable economic theories as to why this societal agreement should be broken.

Gold is good at being money when we don't need an abstract representation of it in order for it to function, because that abstract representation is always messed with given enough time. Even gold bugs like Peter Schiff will openly admit that gold needs an abstract representation to function as money, and he says that blockchain based gold backed tokens make gold better than ever. However these gold bugs fail to see that gold backed digital tokens are just as fallible as gold backed paper, both require trust in a trustee not to issue more tokens than there is gold to back it up. So in essence gold backed crypto suffers the same potential failures as gold backed paper money, ""who watches the watchers"".

This is exactly the problem bitcoin set out to solve and exactly why it is so valuable to society. With gold backed tokens and fiat backed tokens there is always the question of who watches the watchers in order to guarantee scarcity. With bitcoin it is unforgeable energy intensive math equations and decentralised consensus that watches the watchers and enforces scarcity.

The three contenders for global money of the 21st century are tokenized fiat, tokenized gold, or bitcoin. Tokenized fiat is a system without anyone watching the watchers backed by an asset with no watchers, tokenized gold is a system without anyone watching the watchers backed by an asset with scarcity enforced by nature. Bitcoin is a system with unforgable math and decentralised consensus watching the watchers that has a native asset whos scarcity is enforced by that same mechanism of math and consensus.

Bitcoin is the only digital system of money that can guarantee scarcity and responsible monetary management without failing the conundrum of who watches the watchers. This is why bitcoin is the only viable contender as global money for the 21st century.

Gold will resist inflation just like realestate or oil or copper or silver and do well as a store of value alongside other naturally scarce commodities. But only bitcoin is engineered to be money for the 21st century.",3573700,Who watches the watchers,0,1.0,2021-11-18 12:01:10,POSITIVE,0.9985396862030029

The daily revenue from fees currently amounts to about $350,000, or just 2.2 percent of the daily block reward revenue of $15.8 million. As the block reward halving looms, fees will need to increase by 22 times to cover the incoming shortfall in revenue. Otherwise, the hashrate will drop and the security of the network will decrease.

But after the spot price of bitcoin, the most popular  coin approached $69,000 recently, values have entered a turbulent stage.  Though this doesn't mean the rally is over, many would like to know  what to do next.

So, what do you do when your digital assets like bitcoin crash?

**Accept it**

For  those who have been investing in cryptocurrencies for years, dramatic  gains and losses are nothing new. For seasoned bitcoin investors, lower  prices are welcome. See the drop of value in bitcoin as an opportunity  to purchase.

**Understand your risk appetite**

Before  deciding to invest in bitcoin or other cryptos, consider whether an 80%  to 90% down move in your crypto holdings would cause you to lose sleep  at night. If the answer is yes, don’t invest.

**Avoid buying large amounts of cryptocurrency all in one shot**

Buy  a small amount every month and then just keep doing it, as the price  goes up or the price goes down, as opposed to buying it all in this one  single crystalized cost which you’re going to have to deal with  psychologically for the foreseeable future.

**Hodl and earn**

Fortunately,  today many platforms allow you to earn cryptocurrency passively. If  you'll see the interest rate in the bank -  you'll probably laugh in the  face of the manager, then in the cryptocurrency market, you can earn up  to a solid 17% per annum. This approach will only help you to increase  your capital in the future.

Let's  hope this rally is not over yet. However, always keep your eyes open.

Ok that's cool so you may think that I have the answer of my question, but not really. Because less people know that the Bitcoin can be split only on 8 decimals (like that 0,12345678 BTC) and you know as well that ""every 4 years"" (210 000 block) a halving take place and reduce by two the reward for the miner. That means one day the reward will be 0.00000001 then 0.00000000. And that day some people seems to have calculate that we will have a total of 20 999 999.9769 BTC in the wild, so this time you may think again that I have my answer but NO !

First of all I found different results on the total number of BTC, some say 20 999 999.9796 some other 20 999 999.977 and a lot are saying 20 999 999.9769 (I think this is the correct one but if someone can help me find out which one is correct). Then my goal is to retrace all block reward not fully generated, yep we have some miners that didn't take the entire reward. Here are the ones I know (older to newest) :


- Block 124724 : Bitcoin mined = 49.99999999 on 50
- Block 164246 : Bitcoin mined = 48.24219931 on 50
- Block 501726 : Bitcoin mined = 0 on 12,5

So from this we can calculate that 14,2578007 BTC will never be generated on the Blockchain and never exist but I m not sure of what I m saying and I need help to know if we can really say that 14,2578007 BTC can be subtracted  to the final number of Bitcoin available at the block 6 930 000 or not.

If I am correct, do someone know some other block with lower block reward than what it should be ? Do you have sites that list them or tools to hunt them ?",3600413,How many EXACT number of Bitcoin will EXIST when the last block will be mined ?,0,1.0,2021-11-25 18:50:51,NEGATIVE,0.9996984004974365

In 2000, the 10-year treasury bond yielded 6.7% ([https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year](https://www.multpl.com/10-year-treasury-rate/table/by-year)). Today, the federal government has $29T in debt and $4T in yearly tax revenue ([https://www.usdebtclock.org/](https://www.usdebtclock.org/)). 6.7% \* $29T = $2T. This creates a sort of natural cap on how high the federal reserve can raise interest rates (they went up to 15% to fight inflation in the 1970s and 80s.) Thus, they'll have no choice but to stay between 2% and 5% until inflation eats up the debt (which you'll see by a increase in GDP and thus an increase in taxes, both in dollar-terms but not in real value). So either inflation stays down all on it's own, or it goes up on it's own. But if the fed needs to raise interest rates above 5%-ish to stop it, they just can't without bankrupting the federal government.

**Assertion 2: The federal reserve bonds can't pay real returns.** If inflation is already above 5%, and the federal reserve can't raise interest rates above 5%, then it can't pay real returns on bonds.

Let me start saying I am no economist nor expert in the implementation details of Bitcoin.

There are several places like BlockFi where you get paid interest on your bitcoin, but AFAIK the catch is that you need to send them your coins first, with the obvious risk of not getting them back ever. So I thought: would it be possible to incorporate in the Bitcoin protocol something like time locks, but the other way around?  Like an expiry date for transactions. Say we are in block 700,000 and you have an output A, spendable.  You publish a transaction t1 where you just spend A, creating two new outputs B and C, but attached to t1 is its expiry date/block, for instance block 800,000. The idea is that due to the consensus everyone would agree that the meaning of this is that once block 800,000 is reached, transaction t1 should at all effects be ignored.  Transactions spending B, C or any output that resulted from spending those, are ignored as well, the whole tree of transactions starting from t1 is considered pruned. On the other hand transactions spending A (if properly built and signed) are valid, making output A spendable by you (again!).

Immediately after t1 is published in the blockchain B and C are spendable, but everyone can see that those outputs will vanish at block 800,000.  Like Cinderella's chariot, which looks great but will be gone at midnight!  I thought maybe this makes them utterly worthless, but asking a friend economist he said that should not be the case, specially if the expiry date is reasonably far in the future. If transaction t2 spends B and produces D and E, those also indirectly inherit the expiry date. What I cannot figure out is how you could mix those with normal coins, maybe you should just not be allowed to do that (if you do, the transaction would be invalid).

My point is that if people would deem those outputs-with-expiry valuable, even at a small fraction of the value of the normal output for the same amount, then you could lending bitcoin with no counterparty risk. Just the cost of opportunity, knowing that until block 800,000 you won't be able to do anything with output A, but that from that moment you can spend it, no matter what. For a long term hodler that should be no big deal. Thus more coins would be circulating, but in this expiry-attached form. I know no form of money with which something like this could be feasible.

Given supply and demand, a discount-factor-like temporal structure for bitcoin with different maturities would arise. As the maturity of an output gets close its value tends to zero, and as it tends to infinity, its value tends to that of a normal output for the same amount with no expiry. This means the value of the coins lent decreases with time, which makes sense to me, the same happens with the usability of money received as a loan as the time to give it back gets closer (unless you decided not to pay back, of course).

Are there any huge flaws in this idea? Is something on these lines doable (surely with modifications)? If so, maybe it might turn harmful or dangerous?  Does any of the current BIPs (like covenants) cover something similar?

Somehow it is like a simple form of programmable money, that facilitates loans free of counterparty risk. I might be reinventing the wheel here, because I did no research on this topic.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz is seeking to strip language defining who is a crypto ""broker"" from a multibillion-dollar infrastructure package that was just signed into law. 

According to a [statement](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-repeal-infrastructure-bills-devastating-attack-on-emerging-cryptocurrency-industry) from Cruz's office, [the proposed legislation](https://www.cruz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/20211115.cryptobill.pdf) would, if passed, remove language aimed at tightening reporting requirements for ""brokers"" in the digital asset space. The legislation mirrors an [earlier attempt](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/113707/sen-portman-throws-support-behind-amendment-to-his-crypto-provision-in-infrastructure-bill) by Cruz to eliminate the language from the infrastructure package in August, as previously reported. 

The original inclusion triggered a raft of efforts by crypto industry advocates to either amend or remove the language, though these efforts ultimately failed. The infrastructure package was signed into law Monday by US president Joe Biden. Supporters of the definitions have said the expanded definition would help provide funding for the infrastructure package. 

Notably, some of the other senators involved in the pushback [have proposed their own legislation](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/124388/senators-wyden-and-lummis-to-introduce-crypto-amendment-to-bidens-infrastructure-bill) that would revise some of those rules. 

By contrast, Cruz is once again trying to cut the provisions entirely.

""As a deliberative body, the Senate should have done its job and held hearings to properly understand the consequences of legislating on this emerging industry before we risked the livelihoods and privacy of participating Americans,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I urge my colleagues in the Senate to repeal this harmful language that will create regulatory uncertainty and in turn an unnecessary barrier to innovation.""",3567878,Ted Cruz seeks repeal of Biden infrastructure bill's crypto broker definition@ Michael McSweeney,0,1.0,2021-11-17 02:02:27,NEGATIVE,0.997876763343811

My Dad was was interested in bitcoin very early (Around 2012-2013) and claims to have purchased some, made a wallet on his computer, and had a key on a flashdrive. He loves the idea of decentralized currencies, but doesn't have the best computer skills. The USB stick was lost ages ago (when bitcoin was still relatively unknown), he couldn't locate the wallet on his computer, and he believed the bitcoins were lost. 

A year ago I transferred a copy of my parents' HDD to my computer when I helped them move, and looked through it in hopes of maybe recovering the coins. Originally I didn't find anything, but today I came across a folder labeled ""Crypto"" inside a Microsoft folder. It contains another folder labeled ""RSA"", and inside that folder is another one named a long string of characters. Inside the long string folder is 8 files, each also with a name of long and seemingly random characters, but each one ends the same way. The 8 files don't seem to have a file type, but Windows is labeling them as system files. I'll attach screenshots which will hopefully make this easier to understand.  


I don't have high hopes of recovering anything, but I have no idea what I've found. Is there a program that creates a folder named ""RSA"" and stores wallet information there? I blocked out a bunch of the characters. I have no idea what I'm looking at, so I don't want to accidentally show a private key or something.  


Again, I have no idea what I'm doing. But thanks for any help,

Joe Biden says infrastructure bill will build new infrastructure like roads, clean water, public transport, provide internet to the people in the USA and many more. I am confused, is USA a poor 3rd world country like a poor country in Africa that does not have these facilities and are required to make the USA a developed country?

The president also says that this is deflationary that is increase competition between companies causing lowering prices and he said it fixes the supply chain issues/shortages that will lower prices.

Is the Infrastructure bill paid by the taxpayers or from the money printer from the fed? If Money printer then how is the infrastructure bill deflationary cause the fed printed a s\*\*\* load of money to pay for this which is inflationary right?

Why is the DXY Dollar Index Chart going up when there has been high inflation, there has been no interest rates increased and there still is Quantitative Easing still going on till the middle of next year. I don't get it confused.

DXY is putting pressure on Bitcoin otherwise Bitcoin would have been $100k by now.

I don't understand how the fed can keep inflation under control unless they raise interest rates matching the inflation rate &amp; stop QE too. I'm talking about raising interest rates to like 10% minimum as I don't understand how a silly small 0.25% quarter of 1% raise will tackle inflation. I don't get it.

I was talking to a girl. All very well until she told me about the possibility of losing her job. I told her it's a shame that Biden is intentionally collapsing the dollar. She threw a tantrum.

Why are americans like this?

Many currencies are appreciating against the dollar. Many think that it is a good monetary management by our central banks. the reality is that it is the dollar that is being depreciated against other currencies. all the money issued since 2020 and that which will be issued, will have a catastrophic effect in the coming years. current inflation is just the tip of the iceberg. It is a shame that the United States is concentrating on harassing China and Iran, financing Israel wars and LGBT things while destroying its productive system and marking the majority of the population as domestic terrorists. Now they want to track every transaction.

The crisis will force you to live with much less, and be dependent on the government much more. This will eventually lead to you living in a small apartment in a tenement building and getting “universal basic income” via an app on your phone. You will be able to use these digital credits to buy porno subscriptions or vegan food. 

You will keep getting more and more vaccines. Probably, the same app that your CBDCs are on will also alert you when it is time to go get your latest booster.

The solution to all this is to buy more crypto. The governments' war against financial freedom can only end in a total collapse of the system with two possible paths: our total enslavement or our total freedom.

The benefit of Bitcoin is that it is sound money – it is a limited supply, which means that it cannot be inflated. The government cannot rob you by printing money and making your money worthless. It is also a perfect balance of transparency, privacy and independence.

I'm new to reddit and new to exchanging crypocurrency. Can anybody explain to me how the fees work on bit true please especially limit order fees. I seem to have been charged a load of different fees on every transaction I have made bar 2.

So originally I bought 650,000 coins in a crypto on advice from a friend ages ago. On this first transaction for some reason it doesn't show on my history. Perhaps because I did on the computer and now I'm all set up on phone. When I sold these coins the other day I was only charged 1usd for selling them all.

I then set a limit order to buy again at a lower price. I originally was only going to invest half of my sale money from previously. I then decided to use the whole of my sale money and set another buy limit order. For some reason I must not have pulled the tab across completely and it left me with usdt still in my account. I then set a third buy limit order for the remainder.

All these buy limit orders were for the same price. They went through when the price dropped but the fee for the 1st order which was the largest was only 2usd. The 2nd fee was 6 usd. The 3rd fee for the smallest amount of coins was 7usd.

I really don't understand this at all. Is this simply because I set 3 seperate transactions and  it charges more qith each?

Should I have just cancelled the 1st one after changing my mind and set it as one trade?

And therefore less and less work is needed to maintain our standard of living. One day, that amount of work will be negligible as everything will be done by machines and only those will work who want to work, e.g. people with interesting, creative jobs like artists, scientists etc.

It used to be the general consensus that this would be achieved by means of a UBI.

But that's problematic, because the UBI is based on centralized wealth distribution. It relies on the existence of a state, which frankly I don't think is something we can take for granted.

So can we have a better future, free from wage slavery, but one that doesn't rely on centralized wealth distribution at the same time?

If the automation and the increase in productivity over the past decades had benefited us all equally, the average work week today would be maybe 8 hours and not 40; it is inflation that stole that from us.

Last year I discovered sound money and having studied it, I'm wondering if that can get us there instead. In a world that has sound money, the growth of the economy, the increase of productivity through automation translate to one unit of currency being worth more and more, and therefore every holder of money gets wealthier and benefits from this increase. A socialist dream, but achieved through non-socialist, coercion-free, decentralized means.

A satoshi is all you need. If you can't buy, let's say, a house for it, just wait for the increase in productivity to get high enough that you can. Or bite your teeth (maybe in some temporary wage slavery) and wait a bit longer, so you can buy your dream home for 0.5 sat, and keep the other 0.5 sat to retire on.

I'm coining this term (heh heh ""coining"") since no one else has that I'm aware of. What is the Bitcoin Wish Fountain? It's the BTC wallet belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto that was awarded with 50 bitcoins after mining the Genesis Block on January 3, 2009.

Here's the wallet ID:    
**1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa** 

Here's a link with the latest on this wallet: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa)

The original 50 BTC still remain in this wallet and have never been accessed. At the time of this writing, the wallet's balance is over 68.52 BTC and has been transacted 3105 times, meaning throughout the years people have sent BTC to this wallet totaling over 18.52 BTC. Why people would do this? You would have to ask them, but from this day forth I say we call this the BTC Wish Fountain. Send some Satoshis over to the wallet and make a wish after you send an amount of BTC that you're willing to part with. That simple. 

At the time of this writing 100 Satoshis or .000001 = $0.06. If you send that amount to this wallet you'll probably be paying more in transaction fees so this may end up costing you up to several dollars. Also, try not to be that kid that believed his wish was more likely to come true if he tossed several quarters into the water fountain. You all know who I'm talking about.

Name the parasites waiting around for bitcoin's halving so that the gambling junkies that trade it can bring their excess liquidity over and start a contagion that draws TikTok interest and FOMO's your Walgreens cashier. 

You guessed it: Alt-coins are these parasites.

Consider the second largest parasite by market cap. It's a tokenized dystopia that claims to be a gateway to web 3.0. I can't imagine anything that would drive people back to web 2.0 faster than arriving at the gate of that circus. In fact it's like Egypt arming vendors with clubs and swords. How long could a tourist stay on their camel en route to the pyramids? Would the camel even make it? 

Blockchains outside bitcoin's network have a money problem. They don't seem to know what that is. They think money is TPS, TX cost, or throughput. It's not, those are all features of a blockchain. 

**If an application has its own token, it is a scam, it does not offer a service of value.**

The only service it offers is optimizing interaction with more and more tokens. DeFi will be a very important part of the new financial world, but it won't require tokens. The version we've come to accept currently is an abomination. There's absolutely nothing of value taking place, but it's fun watching people talk and act like there is. It's a closed orgy. 

I'm losing patience explaining to people who'll never find the education to navigate this space. This education is of course important, but I'm beginning to see why so many OG's avoid subs like this and talking about BTC in general. Because maybe they've  realized bitcoin has to find them. And over time they have to develop a relationship with Bitcoin that's good enough for them to trust it. I've got no doubt it has the power to do that. 

So bitcoin runs on a network that uses only bitcoin. Then there's the L2 Lightning Network (probably not commercial until 2024) which is a payment rail that anyone can plug-and-play a business onto. No third-parties, no middle-men, no processors to pay. This P2P payment rail only accepts bitcoin. And because your business services or products are on a Dapp built on the Lightning Network, you only get paid by customers in bitcoin. There are no tokens. No confusion on what money is. Only bitcoin. Real businesses. No bullshit. These businesses can be small, like selling watermelons from your truck, or enormous, like online gaming giant Epic who owns Fortnite. These businesses can be brick-and-mortar or online. These businesses are not goofy Dapps trying to get you to swap, stake, wrap, mint, burn, or collateralize tokens to interact with more tokens. And at the end of those P2P payment rails if you so choose, there can be debit cards your funds go onto, or bank accounts anywhere in the world. My small business for example, plans on having these funds deposited into an account in Puerto Rico to reduce my tax burden. It's a place requiring no passport for US citizens and is looking to become the Monte Carlo of the Americas via crypto. But that's just me. Maybe someone else will find El Salvador better suited to their needs, or Cuba if their coming legislation is favorable enough. Plenty of places will certainly pop up to accommodate your business status  for tax purposes. But don't think for a second the hard wallet shouldn't get plenty of attention as well. And don't think either that the banks will last long, because as this network grows, people will slowly stop trading their bitcoin for fiat, now able to buy everything in bitcoin.

Bitcoin is stupid simple, and that's the only way this all works commercially. 

Soon we'll watch nation state's abilities to levy taxes become impaired, and the swift demonetization of the political class. When they no longer control the money, their prestige will fall. Only projects of value with transparent accounting will be enough to get a payment channel opened. And like shitcoins, they'll be neither missed nor remembered.",3572042,Avoiding the tokenized dystopia of other blockchains is why Bitcoin savages them.,0,1.0,2021-11-18 01:36:24,NEGATIVE,0.943816602230072

With the Swedish proposal to the EU and the recent article to NYT, there is going to be a lot of traffic about the evils of Bitcoin's wasteful energy usage.  Especially in light of ETH moving to PoS, there is pressure for PoW coins to do the same or to die under regulatory environmental pressure.

Here are my counter arguments

### Everything uses energy

There is likely a pre-industrial ""sweetspot"" where humans produce the least carbon per person, but our society has decided it like things that came around since then like antibiotics and the internet.  At some level, there is some hierarchy of ""goodness"" that we decide is worth the energy expense.

As an example... HTTPS (encryption / SSL) consumes more energy than HTTP (unencrypted).  But either CAN be used for data exchange.  HTTPS is just better because it provides more freedom of use since data is protected.  But it uses more energy.  Every SSL packet has to go through an encryption and decryption phase that burns more electricity then the same comms on HTTP.  But at some point we have decided the benefit SSL provides is worth the extra greenhouse gasses it produces.

Same goes for many aspects of our life where we accept the movement from the pre-industrial sweetspot because we like our stuff.

### Financial Autonomy

There are still 2 billion people in the world that will be brought ""online"" in the future.  These are people in places / environments where broadband infrastructure is either nonexistent, or too expensive for all groups.  As they come online they will have access to alternatives to the existing banking system that they have had in the past.

Bitcoin solves the ""unbanked"" problem and is likely of more human good to the poor than any benefit it offers to the wealthy.  Once online with the affluence of a smart phone they can literally hold their life savings without the need of a third party.  This is a really big deal that most in the west can't fully appreciate.  Previously people had find a financial institution to hold funds and trust that they wouldn't steal them.  This ""red lining"" is rampant in areas where various ethnic groups are shunned and disallowed.  Bitcoin is not prejudicial, if you have the keys, you are a bitcoin holder, regardless of race, religion or creed.

### PoW -vs- PoS

In order for Bitcoin to remain non-prejudicial, it must remain decentralized.  With decentralization there is no fear that a centralized authority will start excluding groups due to prejudicial beliefs.  And the best way to ensure decentralization is through PoW.  There are much longer debates then I can present on PoW -vs- PoS, but it is my belief that PoW is better at decentralization.  Feel free to find your own best paper on PoW -vs- PoS.

### Bitcoin is worth it

So given the potential of financial freedom free of prejudicial authoritarian regimes, I think Bitcoin earns it's place on the list of things, like encryption, that the world deems as ""worth it"".  Of course there will always be some that believe the energy demand the world needs to target is lower or higher than current goals.  But Bitcoin, like SSL, is really something that can improve the lives of those that need to be free of oppression.",3571527,Bitcoin -vs- Global Warming,0,1.0,2021-11-17 22:13:21,NEGATIVE,0.9706666469573975

Am hoping someone can clear this up for me. I’m guessing this is a simple case of “there are no coins” but I’ve had an old wallet.dat file from back in 2013. 

Have just used a new computer to download butcoincore and let it sync for a few days until it was up to date. 

I found the new wallet.dat and renamed it then used my old wallet.dat and pasted it into the same location. Closed bitcoincore and reopened it. 

It came up with an amount of btc and a few transactions received and sent all in 2013 but still with an available balance. 

I tried to send a portion to an exchange wallet I have and it asked for my wallet passphrase which I remembered but it sits unconfirmed and when I check the details for the transaction I see “status 0/unconfirmed, not in memory pool”

I downloaded electrum and tried to import address it private keys and when I pointed to my 2013 wallet.dat nothing would happen other than random characters showing but no ability to hit the “next” button.

It started with an “oh shit” feeling this morning. I was just thinking through what a world based on a Bitcoin standard would look like (when most countries would use it as their reserve currency) and realized there was a flaw in government use. When one party has a significant Bitcoin holding that they are using for funding, why would any good dictator give that up during a peaceful transition of power? Those who hold the keys (pun intended) to the chest, hold the power. Uh oh - I don’t like the idea of investing in something if I don’t see a future in it. But…

**The solution it seems (as I’m sure many of you have thought about, or probably come up with even better ways) is for there to be complete transparency on the Bitcoin addresses that the government uses** - from tax collection to department allocation, even down to individual government employees if you wanted to. The nature of the public ledger allows for complete transparency of government funds. Each department would have its Bitcoin address published on government website.

You could then track exactly how much they are collecting in taxes and where it is going - no hidden slush funds! *hint, I think they’re going to hate this idea*

When it comes time for the government to transition, the new party would then publicly state what their new addresses are, and the citizens could watch and verify that the transition of monetary power takes place. If not, then you know government funds are being held hostage, and the citizens can come up with a way to handle that (I’d refuse to accept any Bitcoin that originated from the old government address - if others did the same, they immediately lose power).

I have nobody to share this news with since I keep my finances private so figured I'd celebrate it with you all!

&amp;#x200B;

I originally started buying small amounts of BTC back in 2014 (big thanks to discovering this subreddit and researching how it worked) and told all my friends about it telling them they should buy small amounts and they all thought I was crazy. I was pretty broke and could only afford about $50/week here and there and my original investment was somewhere in the ballpark of $4-5k.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I cashed out half of my winnings back in 2017 around the height of that bubble and started reinvesting in 2018. My friends once again thought I was crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my friends are jealous and they think I might own ""one whole bitcoin"" and they've started to only buy some now out of FOMO. It took a lot of discipline and diamond hands to hodl all this time but I'm glad I did. I'm only 30 so I still plan to stay in BTC/ETH for the long-haul and only cash out some when I need money for the down payment on a home.

Cheers to the new ATH and many more to come!

It was 2016, I was a college student and I didn't know enough about bitcoin. I kept telling people it would one day go up, but I NEVER would have expected what it is at today.

I owned 6 bitcoin, spending and selling it freely, thinking nothing of it. At the time, BTC was around $400 a coin.

It pains me to think of that $2400, which today would be nearly $390,000... from the view of someone who makes $25,000 a year, that is absolutely life changing money. Not to mention this is JUST what I had in bitcoin. I had another $5,000 or so in savings, and CONSTANTLY made jokes about putting it all into bitcoin. Little did I know that joke would go on to be one of the biggest regrets of my life. 

Love seeing everyone here who did profit off of bitcoin, so happy for all of you!

On a side note* i do find a little peace in the fact that I would have probably sold when BTC reached $20,000.

4. Life is to play games with God, if you don’t all in, there will be no play

People like to say that Saylor is a ""zealot"" (zealot). On this point, Seiler admitted more than twenty years ago.

""My belief is: if you want to play a game, it's best to all in. There are no exceptions. I don't believe that those who keep one hand will have the last laugh.""

Seiler believed in Christianity and was baptized. But in his view, life in the real world is like playing a game with God.

""Look at my ring-there is a dam, right, and a beaver. This beaver is playing games with God in the waves. Edison is also playing games with God. Rockefeller, Carnegie... these people are all Like me, I’m just playing a game in my life.""

Like the founders of other Internet companies, Seiler also has a life experience that is almost legendary. After a whole life of hesitation and struggle, I have a deep experience of life like a play.

On February 4, 1965, Thaler was born in Nebraska. Because his father was an Air Force officer, he moved from an early age to military bases in Japan, New Zealand, Nebraska, and Florida. At the age of 11, the family began to settle in Ohio, in Fairborn County near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This base is where the legendary remains of flying saucers and alien corpses are hidden.

When he was a child, Saylor lived next to the air base where alien bodies were said to be hidden

Seiler is a good boy who loves to read and has a good reputation in his alma mater, Fairborn High. At the graduation ceremony, he was selected as the representative of outstanding graduates to speak; the whole school conducted voting activities, he was selected as the ""most likely to succeed."" A classmate Spahr later recalled: ""This guy reads more books than all of us. Tell him something, he can always take you to ancient Greece and Rome to talk about it.""

It is precisely because of the yearning for the ""Axis Age"" (Note: proposed by the German philosopher Alexandre, referring to the ancient Greek and Roman era, which is roughly equivalent to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period in China), that Seller is always on top. Philosophical Twitter:

""Bitcoin is a group of network wasps. They serve the goddess of wisdom, rely on the fire of truth for a living, and become smarter, agile, and powerful at an exponential rate. There is a wall of encrypted energy behind them.""

""Internet Hornet"" drawn by a Twitter netizen based on Thaler's post

Once, a media interviewed Seiler and asked him why he likes to read so much. His answer may be something that 99% of people can never guess:

His parents want him to read ""serious books"", and Seiler likes to read comics. 25 cents for a comic book is too expensive for a child. In order to cultivate Thaler’s study habits, the family made a decision: As long as Thaler finished reading a ""serious book"", they would pay him a dime (10 cents). In this way, in order to save money to buy comic books, Seiler desperately read classics, holding a book wherever he went.

He has understood since childhood: the more books he reads, the more money he earns, so that he can exchange more things he wants in the market. Therefore, in one summer vacation, he can finish reading a hundred ""serious books"". Even as the boss of an Internet company, Seiler still retains the habit of reading paper books.

On the first day of college, Seiler went to class wearing a T-shirt with the sleeves off. The T-shirt is printed with the Def Leppard (Def Leppard) pattern. In the 1980s, the Def Leppard and Michael Jackson were unmatched. He also trimmed his beard to look like a band member, so that when he gets close to him, he smells a strong smell of heavy metal. During college, he also liked to jump to the roof and play the guitar in the dead of night, making ""strange sounds"".

Brothers like to call him ""Nuclear"". Seiler seems to like the nickname, half drunk and half awake once said: ""I was a'nuclear engineering' major from the beginning, and my personality is quite irritable. Sometimes when you are close to me, I can feel a flame burning. As long as I’m there, everyone has to retreat and disperse like nuclear fission.”

Seiler also has a temperament of ""returning after all his money is gone"", so he is not so sensitive to many things. In the year he became the richest man in Washington, D.C., a neighbor drove Thaler's house into a mess, and the furniture, gas pipes, and exterior walls were all broken. Later, recalling the car accident, he said lightly: ""It's no big deal. The five minutes to go to the scene are interesting. But it's really meaningless. Everything in the office is better than this guy driving to my house. It’s ten thousand times more important. I criticized the secretary at the time, saying: Just call me and tell me about this mess? Why do you want me to go to the scene? There was something wrong with the house, and it’s not life and death. I don’t even bother to blink my eyes. Anyway, broken things can always be fixed. What a big deal.""

When he first graduated, Seiler worked for DuPont, an accounting giant, to make data models for them to predict growth. Thaler predicted that there would be a huge bubble in the last decade of the 20th century, and DuPont's performance would plummet.

The executives were very unhappy, thinking that Thaler's Windows computer was running too slow, so he made a mistake, and asked him to recalculate it with an Apple computer. At that time, Seiler insisted on his own opinion and quarreled with the company for a long time. In the end, DuPont decided to pay Seiler a salary of 350,000 US dollars and let him start a company for analysis instead of staying in DuPont's office. This money later became the founding fund for Thaler to create the micro-strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

His personality is too strong and unpredictable, so despite many secrets, he is still single and never married.

In the company, his character also makes employees love and hate. Micro-strategy was once nominated by Fortune magazine as one of the 100 best employers, but the chaos of internal management also made employees feel very uncomfortable.

On one occasion, Seiler told reporters in Washington, D.C.:

""I never said that I want to change everything in the world. But if I want to lead the world from ignorance to knowledge, or even'omniscience', there is something religious in it. But to be honest, if God came to the world In time, he will be very disgusted with the world now.""

Strong personality, perseverance and unhesitating spirit, belief in all in philosophy, from this perspective, it is not surprising that Seller bet on Bitcoin.

5. Understand and then believe

On May 15 this year, Seiler posted a very short tweet:

""Bitcoin is eternal"".

Saylor’s ""Bitcoin Eternity"" Tweet This Year

It has to be said that having such a wizard betting on Bitcoin is both a fortune and a disaster for the Bitcoin community.

As a book-loving Christian, Seiler should understand that in medieval Christianity, there was a controversy that affected the history of modern science: Is it because of belief that people understand the content of their beliefs? Or is there faith because you understand the content?

Thaler's Bitcoin beliefs are not groundless. Before deciding to buy Bitcoin, he has carefully compared various investment options such as cash, bonds, stocks, gold, real estate and Bitcoin.

""Based on the current supply of M2 in U.S. dollars, it will increase by 5% in 2020 and 24% every year in the next 20 years. This means that purchasing power is declining. At least for the next 3-4 years, what we have Banknotes depreciate by 15% every year. The macro economy still has an annual inflation rate of 2%. After this account is calculated, the Fed is like sneaking into your backyard and blatantly robbing your wealth.""

In the currency market, the U.S. dollar will become weaker and weaker. This means that the capital market, real estate market, commodities, and gold are not good. The actual rate of return on investment is almost zero or even negative. ""In contrast, ""Bitcoin is a hundred times better than gold, or even a million times better."" I will not sell Bitcoin. I want to hold Bitcoin for a hundred years. ""

Of course, countless people have asked him: Isn't your company doing Bitcoin ETF? If Bitcoin falls, won't the company be over?

Seiler is very firm: ""Bitcoin is not a security at all! Bitcoin is currency!""

For him, understanding is faith, and faith is understanding. This is true whether it is Christianity, earthly life, or Bitcoin.

In the eyes of the outside world, the huge volatility of Bitcoin means extremely high risks, and the combination of leverage makes the company on the verge of bankruptcy at any time, which is extremely disrespectful to investors. In addition, the high degree of simplification of the investment portfolio also exposes micro-strategy stocks to similar or even higher risks to Bitcoin, and is a strong sell target.

However, with Thaler's character, even if Bitcoin does plummet, it is estimated that he will not ""repent"".

People are arguing whether bitcoin is intrinsically libertarian, or right wing, or politically neutral. I submit for your consideration that this way of thinking might only makes sense before satoshi. 

What if, after satoshi, politics changed, permanently?

Before satoshi, reliably owning _anything_, of any kind, in a way that it couldn't be taken from you, required violence. Because violence is expensive and risky, ownership evolved to relying on courts and an entire hierarchical system for resolving disputes. If that hierarchy broke down, there would be violence. But the base layer of the stack was always violence. 

You might see these dispute resolution mechanisms as being [a distributed consensus mechanism](https://apxhard.com/2021/05/09/distributed-consensus-algorithms-in-the-animal-kingdom/). In other words,  ""proof of work + longest chain"" should be seen as an alternative to things like courts and armies. 

During the english revolution, some people  proposed giving everyone the right to vote. But the intellectuals agreed this didn’t work - they wanted a ‘proof of stake’ model where only landowners (i.e. stakeholders) could vote.  This time period - in the 1500’s - also saw a nascent communist sect (the diggers) as well as the origin of ideas like freedom of religion. We’ve been having the same ‘before satoshi’ arguments for hundreds of years.  

 Bitcoin is, indeed, something new under the sun.  

After satoshi, yes, you _can_ own property without needing violence or courts. 

After satoshi you can send that property long distance, without needing roads that are maintained by states and protected with violence and the threat thereof.  The lightning network is the first way to send value, anywhere in the world, more or less instantaneously, more or less free, without relying on a _single specific_ hierarchy that uses violence to enforce claims on property.

Yes, virginia, there is one hierarchy today.  The dominant hierarchy that exists today has no name; 'bretton woods' or Davos might be as close as we get.  This hierarchy is made up of nation states, of courts, of militaries and banks and NGO's and people meeting in Davos to buy $30 hotdogs in 2016, before they exported their inflation to the rest of us.  This hierarchy is also made up of drug cartels, mafia states, and terrorist millionaires like osama bin laden.   The hierarchy consists of the chinese communist part, the democrats, the republicans, corporate media, big technology, and every other existing corporation that has a stake in keeping the current game going.

This hierarchy has used 'before satoshi' politics to keep itself intact. 

The costs this hierarchy has imposed on us are nameless and uncountable. Debt, misery, violence, fear, genocide. Widespread anxiety stress and panic as we realize the world is far beyond our control.  Neighbors fighting neighbors. Babies having babies. These are the costs inherent in 'before satoshi' politics, a layer of violence concealed by a layer of kabuki theatre.  The cheap seats are miserable; if you can pay the cost, the expensive seats reward you for sitting closer. And if you’re brave and gutsy enough, you can even get up on the great stage. Pay no attention to the stage crew, management is making sure they are taken care of. Welcome to the greatest show on earth. They call it “the aristocrats.”

In contrast,  the entire bitcoin infrastructure operates based upon individuals freely and voluntarily interacting and exchanging with each other.   You might object that mining facilities still need property rights and violence. You're right about this!

Yes, each individual node in the bitcoin network still _DOES_ require physical infrastructure, and thus courts, armies, the rule of law, etc.  Every fiber optic cable that makes up the network still does require a system of courts to resolve a situation in which a cow is buried upon the fiber cable, crushing the cable and blocking traffic.  What happens if that cable drifted into someone else’s property due to tectonic shift. Who’s liable for the repair costs? And what of the emotional damage to old betsy’s children who saw, from the corner of their factory farm, mama’s corpse dug up by a backhoe? (This actually happened once - I spent years working at google on this kind of physical infra. Not all of it, but the “cow buried on a fiber cable” part.)

But remember the concept of stacks! Don't just stack your sats! Stack your model of causality so that you can see how 'layers' of reality form computational stacks!

Human societies are stacks: commerce relies on the law, the law relies on violence.  Bitcoin is a new layer on top of the existing stack which *doesn't need violence.*  We might think of bitcoin, again, by analogy to TCP - a purely consensual layer of global human interaction. Even though individual packets can be dropped, TCP connections that use lossy packets can still reliably deliver messages.  

TCP enables a form of communication that is pure and correct atop a system of noise and loss.  Bitcoin - built atop of TCP - is the same, only it allows us to communicate about one of the most important aspects of human reality - the scarcity which constrains our material existence.   

So yes, _pieces_ that make up bitcoin's infrastructure rely on violence - just as individual packets that make up a TCP message can indeed be lost.  Just as the signals that make up an ethernet frame can be garbled or lost.  The powerful mathematics of information theory allowed humans to build lossless communication mechanisms atop of lossy ones. The powerful mathematics of computer science allowed us to build a violence-free way of interacting at scale.

Bitcoin, a nonviolent form of interacting, will become the new global norm. Our old “before satoshi” politics are now meaningless! They are arguments over what we should do in the absence of bitcoin. 


Before satoshi, all systems of property rights were built atop a system for projecting violence.  We might see all of before-satoshi politics as being arguments about the system of property ownership - who should pay for that system of violence, and how much? Since we have this system for doing violence and enforcing property rights in place, what else should it do? Anything? Everything?

The best proof that bitcoin is nonviolent is to consider what happens in case of a future world war. Bitcoin would still run. Nations could cut themselves off of bitcoin, but capital controls have been notoriously difficult to enforce in history - especially in times of crisis. Each nation state might lay claim to all of the resources inside of it, just as FDR grabbed everyone's gold prior to world war two, and both the nazi regime and the soviets insisted that it was the state that  has rights to all resources.  They _had_ to do this to fund their war. That world war can’t happen today because the nation states can’t seize property from their members, through heavy taxes and inflation, to pay for the war. Britan just recently finished paying for debt from world war one, over a hundred years ago.  That is the nature of before-satoshi politics. Debt and violence are the two ends of a pair of handcuffs.

Before satoshi, If your country was invaded, none of your property rights would be secure.

After satoshi, there is now a form of property rights that does not require any _specific_ system of violence at all.  After satoshi, if your country is invaded and taken over by a hostile power, you can leave with most of your wealth in your brain, and the invaders can't take it. They may not even know you _have_ it. This is a revolution in human affairs.

Bitcoin will likely enforce and protect property rights, not with one expensive hierarchical system of violence, but with numerous smaller systems that will be forced to compete on cost. Hard money will pay for private defense, and invasion will be such a terrible investment that nobody would bother.  You can’t seize wealth like invading armies used to.  Nation states will still exist, they’ll still skm off the top as always, but they’ll be reduced to the status of homeowners associations.  Most people dislike their HoA’s, but none of our HoAs has printed a trillion dollars or bombed their own citizens without trial or constructed a global panopticon that spies of all of us. The bad ones will annoy people enough that they will move out, and this will force them to change.  



Let's call this situation what it is: the death of 'before satoshi' politics. After satoshi, new political coalitions and factions will emerge.  The old divisions are dead and busted. They only make sense before satoshi.

It's time for politics after satoshi.",3578373,Politics After Satoshi,0,1.0,2021-11-19 15:31:14,POSITIVE,0.8577653765678406

I have been digging into this looking to mine Bitcoin with large wind farm, but I'm finding it doesn't make sense for two reasons:

1. ASICs suffer from thermal cycling if you turn them on and off with the wind. (There is no way it is economical to use batteries to store the wind power, batteries would need to be at $10/kWh or less and today they are at $100+/kWh).
2. If you only mine Bitcoin while electricity is cheap (i.e. off-peak) it means you aren't using the ASICs all of the time, which means my payback period is much longer.

Has anyone economically been able to use wind or solar for Bitcoin mining?

I believe that the government is increasingly lying, deceiving, and manipulating. They have undoubtedly always been liars, but now it has become truly insufferable. In my impression, the best default position is not to believe a word they say.

In mainstream society, lots of people attack me for that point of view.

That is why I automatically end up in the niches, that is, in the nooks and crannies of society where they are more accepting of my total disbelief of contemporary officialdom.

I really do not believe that they have authority to invent new laws with which to tell me what to do. Furthermore, I do not even see why I should believe that?

Furthermore, the most happy event for me of the year, is that the 30-country military occupation force, NATO, finally got smashed to smithereens and kicked out of the mountains of Afghanistan by some local hill tribes.

If that does not rein in their arrogance, then I wonder what will? I am still rejoicing that great news!

As we make our way into 2022, our high expectations continue, edging closer to fruition. Continuous outflows of BTC on exchanges, increasing numbers of long-term bitcoin holders, 50,000 new bitcoin entities per day, and an overall ever-expanding network that bitcoin continues to create; all contributing to the development, demand and success of bitcoin. 

However, after weeks of analysis, I believe we as individuals should be doing everything possible to empower bitcoin. I have determined that reducing the supply of bitcoin is one thing that we can do to do so, which will also increase the demand for bitcoin. This is why I propose we all send any arbitrary amount of bitcoin to the unknown address below, where your Bitcoins can disappear from the circulating supply forever; ultimately contributing to the scarcity of bitcoin.

Never rely on anyone’s predictions on internet. Just follow simple rules and you will just be fine. 

Don’t forget basic rules of investing. 

1)  only invest fiat that you are willing to lose. 
2) don’t put all eggs in one basket 
3) if you are here to make 10x gains then also be ready to swallow 50-70% crashes. 
4) always have extra fiat to DCA with every 10% dip.

[jointhesquidgame.com](https://jointhesquidgame.com/) is the website to join the squid games when it is ready. You will be asked to create an account along with providing a bitcoin address. Once you have created your account you will NEED to send $5 in BTC to the games wallet to reserve your spot for when the game goes live. If you did not reserve your spot you will NOT be able to compete. There will be a 2 months period for people to sign up until the first game goes LIVE. There will only be allowed 5 accounts per IP Address. When the first game goes live you will want to be there because it WILL only run ONCE. It is recommended that you should login and join 30 min. before the game starts (ON A COMPUTER) by going to the same [jointhesquidgame.com](https://jointhesquidgame.com/) website. This is so you can be put into a queue with 49 other people who you will be competing against (there will be many queues). The game will start by first explaining the rules to everybody and how to play. You will then be given ONE practice round before the real round starts. The first one to win the first game will be allowed to go onto the next game WHEN it is ready. Everyone else WILL be eliminated. If you did not win the first game you will NOT be able to move on to the next game. There will be a long series of games that will play out until there is only 1 person left.

 - Use a hard wallet

 - You don't ever write the seed on paper or anything visible. You store it on encrypted SD cards or cards like the ones provided by GridPlus. Make several copies. The password should be your iPhone passcode or something you can't forget. Then you can place these SD cards around because they are very easy to hide and very difficult to find

 - Store real keys to real wallets that you don't use in your phone's photos, on your computer, and written on paper in your home safe, and in your bank's lockbox. Keep a small amount of crypto on these wallets, preferably shitcoins because you never know, but you will know if you've ever been compromised. It will throw off the authorities too if they ever try robbing you by bringing gas tools and a warrant into your local branch, like many stories littering this sub testify to

 - Get insured by a decentralized insurer like NexusMutual

 - Consider smart contracts written into wallets that automatically send your assets to a whitelisted address of your choice if you haven't used it in 365 days

 - Never keep all your funds on a single wallet. Use at least 4. And keep one specifically for spending, and or gifting

 - Don't use Gmail, Yahoo, or other doormats for the NSA. Instead, opt for an encrypted email like ProtonMail

Bitcoin uses UTXO based accounting methods, as opposed to an account-based accounting method. If the UTXO accounting method is used in real life, we will only record the current owner of each banknote. Since this banknote has not been spent by the current owner yet, it is called an Unspent Transaction. If the account balance is needed, a quick calculation will be made by adding the value of all the banknotes held by him/her. In the UTXO model, each UTXO represents the current location of the banknote.  


The account-based accounting method is different. Instead of tracking the location of each banknote, the system simply maintains the account balance of each individual. The accounts can be controlled by a private key, or by a smart contract. A transaction is recorded by adding and subtracting the same amount of tokens from the sender and to the recipient respectively. However, for the purpose of validation, transactions also need to be recorded, but the application developer could ignore it.   


The reason why Bitcoin chose UTXO:  
1.  First of all, it is possible to process multiple UTXOs at the same time, it enables parallel transaction validation and encourages better scalability and efficiency.  While A and B trade with C simultaneously, in the account-based model, both transactions could not be validated in parallel while in the UTXO model, a different UTXO related to C could be used and both transactions could be processed together. Thus, UTXO based smart contracts are relatively easier to scale.   


2.  Secondly, UTXO is inherently easier for privacy-preserving as the account balance of a user is not stored in the blockchain as well as the interim states, although they could be indirectly calculated. UTXO based smart contracts record the interim states locally and provide opportunities for mixing coins and other privacy protection approaches. In the account-based blockchain, the balance of all of the accounts is on the chain.   


3.  Thirdly, UTXO saves the storage space of the blockchain. As mentioned above, UTXO based smart contract only saves the interim states locally and requires less network bandwidth, and does not like the account-based smart contract which is required to save both states and transactions in the blockchain. In a system that has a lot of IoT devices but the interaction between these devices are relatively simple or infrequent, UTXO based smart contract consumes fewer resources. For example, the device only reports its status once an hour, a UTXO based system will not need to update the account balance of each device every a few seconds as the account-based system does.   


4. Fourthly, a UTXO based system is more immune to double spending while an account-based system is vulnerable to it. Each UTXO is unique and it is quite easy to detect that the same one has been used twice. In the accounting system, as the account balance change might be due to multiple reasons, a situational awareness engine is required to identify the double-spending attack.

I see 99% of people on Reddit claiming anyone who doesn’t want their transactions to be tracked only want that because your a “criminal”. No, it’s our right to privacy, but yet so many are perfectly fine that the governments basically know exactly how much Bitcoin you have, how much you use and spend and likely how much you originally payed for it.

For example, I live in America, which is supposed to be the land of the free. Yes the USD is our currency but if I’m truly free I should be able to transfer my CURRENCY to another CURRENCY that I believe in more. That should be my choice and we should NEVER be taxed on the difference in value of the 2 currencies. It’s not our fault governments continue to print endlessly, which fuels further price increases in Bitcoin, which you then legally owe taxes on the difference if you make a purchase.

For example:
If you exchange USD for pounds and a week later each pound is now worth $.02 cents more than the USD then when you converted, imagine if we got taxed on that. It’s no different.

This is absurd. Here in America, I pay income taxes on my income, and I pay social security taxes that I’ll likely never see. I pay property tax. I pay sales tax on every item I buy. If I want to transfer my money to BTC and the value of the BTC relative to the USD increases, that should not be a taxable just because I chose to support a currency that had a fixed supply. I never asked for the value of my currency to drop 5% every year. It should be my right to exchange without fear or repercussions, and I should be able to do so with FULL anonymity.

I'll keep the story as short as I   can.

I was recently in Peru for a  few weeks traveling  around on vacation. It was an amazing 2.5 weeks  until the last 2 days.  On Thursday, Nov 11th I decided to spend the  last couple days of my trip  exploring Miraflores district in Lima,  Peru. Upon landing at the  airport I got a taxi cab from the airport  kiosk and started making my  way to Miraflores. No more than 2 miles  from the airport, in  bumper-to-bumper traffic, I was on my iPhone  (looking up restaurants in  the area - Lima is a foodie paradise) with  the window rolled down when  all of the sudden ... snatch. Someone  walked up behind me in traffic and  stole my iPhone right out of my  hands through the window.

This is  when the nightmare scenario begins. I was initially annoyed just due to  the  fact my iPhone was stolen, and I assumed the perp was likely just  going  to try and sell it. Now I have to go through that whole mess from  Peru, and get home without a phone etc. All of the sudden it hit me ...  he  grabbed my phone while I was on it, meaning if he was able to keep  it unlocked he has access to my email, 2FA etc. By the time I had the  taxi  driver turn around and get back to the airport, approximately  30-45 mins had passed before I could get back into a wifi zone. Luckily I  had my  iPad (no data just wifi iPad), so I immediately reported my  phone as  stolen and FaceTimed a buddy to help me start closing  accounts, that's  when I saw it ... an email confirmation from Coinbase  saying ""transaction successful.""

HE  WAS IN MY CRYPTO ACCOUNTS, converting some of my holdings and  transferring them to his address. Not just that, but  as he was doing  this he was deleting my email confirmations so I could  not see what he  was doing (even going into my trash folder and perm  deleting them).  Panic set it, but it was too late. Coinbase, Binance,  and Trust wallet  (primarily Trust wallet so I don't hold much on  exchanges) all drained  and sent to his address. **$85,000**  in  holdings gone in 30 mins. He obviously knew what he was doing. This  was no joe-schmo and he was likely working with someone else. I  couldn't  believe it - an absolute gut punch. I'm a relatively  tech-savvy person  (moreso than the avg person) and always implement  security measures. I have a metamask as well that he luckily did not go  for or get into, but  he probably could have if he wanted. This guy (or  multiple people) was a  pro, he knew he only had so much time. Didn't go  for my stocks or bank  accounts, only crypto, and afterwards shut the  phone down and likely  threw it in a river. I've played the scenario out  in my head a thousand  times and it's obvious they stake out that  specific area / targeting  tourists in taxi's etc. A million things had  to go right for them to  pull this off as fast and efficiently as they  did.

Additionally,  just so  everyone knows, he had my email and Google Authenticator 2FA  (which  were both obviously on my phone) so he was able to act as me.

I'm devastated. Years and years of saving and investing.

I'm   not letting this take away from my crypto investing, I'm going to get   back into it but this situation really took the wind out of my sails  and  drained me of most of my money. With that said, any method I can  follow  to try and recoup? Coinbase has been absolutely no help up to  this point. Trust Wallet has been very slow to look at my case, and same  with  Binance US. Is there any other way of reporting this in hopes I  can get at least some of my investment back? Any former Navy Seal  mercenaries or drone ops for hire?

Any  help  would be much appreciated and I will answer any questions to  provide further clarity if need be. Thanks, sers - can't do much but  pick myself up and get back in the saddle.

TLDR  - phone got stolen in Peru and worst case scenario happened. My wallets  and accounts got drained. Use lots of passwords and don't stay logged  in to accounts.",3593379,$85k worth of crypto stolen in Peru - A cautionary tale,0,1.0,2021-11-23 17:41:49,NEGATIVE,0.8662309050559998

The 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency' bill will create a facilitative framework for an official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India, and ban all private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Such a pre-verification approach would create obstacles for thousands of peer-to-peer currencies that thrive on being outside the ambit of regulatory scrutiny.

Earlier this month, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said all democratic nations must work together to ensure cryptocurrency ""does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth"" - his first public comments on the subject.

Earlier this year, the government considered criminalising the possession, issuance, mining, trading and transference of crypto-assets.

Money laundering and terror financing?
Modi recently chaired a meeting to discuss the future of cryptocurrencies, amid concerns that unregulated crypto markets could become avenues for money laundering and terror financing, sources separately said on Saturday.

The new rules are also likely to discourage marketing and advertising of cryptocurrencies, to dull their allure for retail investors, said an industry source who was part of a separate parliamentary panel discussion held on Monday.

The government is looking to classify crypto as an asset class, as demanded by the crypto exchanges, rather than as a currency, two sources told Reuters.

But the senior government official told Reuters that the plan is to ban private crypto-assets ultimately while paving the way for a new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

The Reserve Bank of India, which has voiced ""serious concerns"" about private crypto is set to launch its CBDC by December.

Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is hovering around $60,000 (€53,000) and has more than doubled since the start of this year, attracting hordes of local investors.

No official data is available but industry estimates suggest there are 15-20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion rupees (€4.77 billion).[India to ban almost all private cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin in new clampdown

Odell Beckham Jr., who plays in the Los Angeles Football Team, declared that he will now be receiving his salary of $4.2 million all in the form of [Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/). 

On Monday, he announced through a post on Twitter that he would be partnering with the Cash App in order to receive his first salary in the form of Bitcoins. According to Ian Rapoport, a reporter from National Insider, the player would be receiving a staggering amount of $4.25 million for the 2021 season which includes his base pay, a signing bonus and other incentives for joining the team.

According to statistics, his total salary would range somewhere near 75.66 BTC, corresponding to the price of Bitcoin at the time the news broke out. Even though the cryptocurrency had reached its highest peak during November 10th, the price has fallen since then. Beckham currently plays with the Rams in Los Angeles. He has joined the host of athletes from various other sports backgrounds to ride the cryptocurrency wave around the world.

Main St frontran Wall St and more and more of them are becoming true HODLers who will not sell because they now see it for what it is.

While many rely on linear or *lin scale* charts, true pros (which I am not) use logarithmic or **log scale** charts \[1\].

I've compiled a known BTC log scale chart to show you clearly where we are now and where we could be in the future.

# Chart and analysis

[BTC log scale chart; source: Kraken \[2\]](https://preview.redd.it/4svp5b6hr5181.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6058203c9eb75da3d67709920b08217948302d)

On log scale chart prices like $57k, $60k and $63k would all look similar.  That is why it's not really important if you buy the dip at $57k, $60k or $63k. Let's select $60k, since it'll be easier for me to explain the following numbers below.

The BTC log scale chart has 2 trend lines - support and resistance - which form the channel. You can also see that I've marked $12k and $300k on the chart. On the log-scale's vertical axis they both are equidistant from $60k, where one is 5x lower, while the other is 5x higher.

Theoretically now we could be anywhere between $12k on the low and $300k on the high.

# Conclusions

This is a very well-known chart. You can use it to extrapolate the general trend of where BTC is expected to move in relation to USD. This chart also shows that BTC is not expected to ever fall below $12k.

But one mystery I find fascinating is Satoshi and his 1m BTC that haven’t moved in years. 

I’m interested if there are some crazy conspiracy theories out there as to a larger picture of the purpose of BTC global adoption. 

I was thinking during my readings of El Salvadore and the BTC city that wouldn’t it be amazing if Satoshi is from El Salvador and he is prolong this development up. 

Or perhaps this is his way of getting the world together to use more green technology i.e harvesting power from volcanos. 

What if he reappears 15 years from now or a huge manifest is is unleashed across the blockchain when the last BTC is mined with explanation of what his last 1m BTC is to be used for.

If you've watched Squidgame on Netflix you will probably know about the Korean Won right now. Even if it was pretty confusing at first I bet you got a feel for how much 1000 Won is and how much (or how little) it can buy. Now here comes the interesting thing: 1 Won is very similar to 1 Satoshi in value right now (1 Won ~ 1.34 Satoshi)

I think it helps imagining how Satoshi can be used by average people because it seems so unimaginable to many right now, but we actually reached a point where Satoshi is very comparable to already existing currencies in countries and if we wanted we absolutely could already use Satoshi in everyday life and not wait for Bitcoin to hit 1 Million (this is when one SAT would be worth 1 ct)

Scams aside, they’re all copies of Bitcoin. But Solana does 70k transactions a second! But developers are building on Ethereum! Shitcoins.

Bitcoin is the OBVIOUS answer and is the most applicable technology/solution. Most of these shitcoins will not survive the standards that regulators will instill when regulatory clarity has been finalized and moved forward.

One of such projects is the Infinity Ecosystem, a unique user-centric cross-chain DeFi project seeking to revolutionize the decentralized finance market. The project aims to make the DeFi ecosystem accessible to everyone.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Overview of the Infinity Ecosystem*

Infinity Ecosystem is a cross-chain, user-centric, and continuously evolving ecosystem of DeFi protocols and platforms. The ecosystem aims to revolutionize the DeFi space by bringing new value and innovation to the industry. To ensure the DeFi space is available to all, Infinity Ecosystem seeks to provide global, unified, user-friendly interfaces and advanced features designed to ensure both experienced and basic users have the best experience. The ecosystem has protocols that empower decentralized finance for developers, financial institutions, wallets, traders, exchanges, and liquidity providers.

Infinity Ecosystem aims to build innovative and easy-to-use decentralized finance platforms and protocols across different blockchain networks. By doing so, the project offers everyone a possible gateway to financial freedom. The project is not just looking to provide value in the short term; it is out to create long-term value and growth in the DeFi industry. By providing a seamless user experience, Infinity Ecosystem is facilitating easier mainstream adoption. The ecosystem is made of DeFi platforms, protocols, and utility/governance token, such as the open-source Infinity Protocol, new-generation Infinity Crypto decentralized exchange, and the flagship platform Infinity Wallet. Shard is the central utility and governance token across the entire Infinity Ecosystem.  


&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Shard Token*

Shard is the native token used across multiple Infinity platforms and protocols, and it provides unique and diverse benefits, features, governance, and use cases. It is a global, multi-chain, and decentralized token that anyone can access on both Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and [Ethereum](https://www.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd) blockchain. Shard holders govern the Shard token and the Infinity Protocol, and can create proposals, vote on integrations, whitelisting, and treasury usage.

The Infinity Platforms and protocols within the ecosystem have special protocols for burning the Shard token, reducing the coin supply. At present, Shard is burned from 0.05% of the traded volume on the Infinity Protocol, 100% of Shard burn community whitelisting on Infinity Crypto and Infinity Wallet, as well as fees from the Infinity Wallet.

&gt;*Conclusion*

Although the decentralized finance industry is relatively young, projects like the Infinity Ecosystem appear to be positioning for the industry's future. There are very few projects with such an innovative long-term approach, and there is nothing to doubt that Infinity Ecosystem is on the right track. However, in a dynamic industry like this, only time will tell.

I will tell my story simply.

I transacted a lot BTC to an other person who  to the person I owe money. After the transaction completed he said there is no BTC in his wallet after a while we found someone and he said ""I'm working on coinbase recovery department and I can save this BTC's but you need to pay me some commision."" We said Ok and after 1 hour he said protocol started. 

After 3 days he returned and said ""protocol moving so slowly if we want to make it faster we need to pay AntPool fee"" and sended a link to us. It's coinbase transaction link but there was no wallet number or something else there was only AntPool phrase. and we send it he sended me a SS and said look its now %33.

After this sittuation I wanted TXID of those transaction but he said TXID going to occur when the protocol complete.

After 5 days he returned again and said ""we can make it faster again this time need to pay F2Pool fee""

We said OK again and paid this one too

Now after the 3 days he returned again and said ""the protocol about the finish but you need to pay blockchain for the completion of the transaction"" and this was much more money then both of pool fees. We didnt pay this one yet.

&amp;#x200B;

But my questions are,

1) Is there any protocol like he said?

2)Is TXID occur when the transaction finished or started?

The Genesis Block's beginnings were shrouded in the debate about a fine  point of its creation: Was the code that rendered the Genesis Block  effectively untradeable an intention or a mistake on the part of  Nakamoto? 

Although the Genesis Block points to a web address—written into the  Genesis Block's code—that link displayed an error message when  activated. The system could not find the first 50-BTC transaction in its  database, and the spending transaction was rejected. So, the Genesis  Block's transaction is not considered a ""real transaction"" by the  original Bitcoin client. 

But why? Did Nakamoto mean for the first bitcoin to be non-tradeable?  Or, was it a mistake? This became the subject of much debate among  Bitcoin fans and insiders. Because of the precision of this developer,  however, most believe that it was hardly an error. Nakamoto likely wrote  the code for the Genesis Block exactly the way he wanted it.

At today’s exchange rate of 1 BTC = $60,812 that means those 18.78M BTC are worth $1.142 trillion. Wow! That’s a lot!

The current US real estate market is worth an estimated $33.6 trillion. That means all the real estate owners together would sell all their real estate for $33.6 trillion, but no less. That’s their rock-bottom price, otherwise they would rather just keep it.

Some people who own bitcoin also already own some of the $33.6 trillion real estate market, so let’s be generous and assume they already own $3.6 trillion of it free and clear, no mortgage, no debt, they own it. So there’s still $30 trillion in real estate out there, and together all the bitcoiners decide that they would rather own real estate instead of bitcoin. They all collectively decide to reap the rewards of their bitcoin investment and try to buy ALL the real estate in the US in exchange for ALL the bitcoin in existence.

So together all the bitcoin owners communicate to all the real estate owners that they want to buy real estate. 

The real estate owners tell the bitcoin owners that they will not sell their real estate for anything less than $33.6 trillion dollars, which at today’s exchange rate is equivalent to 552.5 million BTC. 

The bitcoin owners plead with the real estate owners: “But we only have 18.78 million BTC, which is equivalent to $1.142 trillion. Why won’t you lower your price? Why won’t you sell us $30 trillion worth of real estate for the $1.142 trillion we are offering? We are offering you a whopping 3.8% of your asking price, why won’t you take it?! You have got to believe us, these bitcoins are going to be worth a lot more in the future! They are going to increase in value so much that someday you will be able to buy the equivalent of $30 trillion dollars in real estate, maybe more, for only $1 trillion! It’s true!” 

So all the real estate owners said “wow, that sounds like a great investment! I’m in!” And they agreed to sell their $30 trillion worth of real estate to the bitcoiners for $1.142 trillion. They signed all the papers, packed up their belongings, evicted all their tenants, and went out to the street.

That is absolute garbage that makes you sound just as awful and greedy as the 1%. I was 9 years old when bitcoin was created. The price of a single coin rose to over $100 before I even got to middle school. On top of that I was born to a less-than-fortunate white trash family, who's never really had extra money just laying around to invest.

 I was 16 before I ever even heard the word ""bitcoin"" spoken by anybody and they weren't even speaking to me. By the time I had my own phone with full time internet access, bitcoin was already over $5k per coin, and I had just started pulling in $250 every 2 weeks working at a sandwich shop. Wasn't bitcoin created to help everybody? To help pull people out of poverty? People like Me?

 Then along comes a bunch of spoiled and entitled people like the ones on this sub. People that enjoy saying things like ""you buy bitcoin at the price you deserve"". Really? I deserve to not make insane gains like you because I was a child with no access to bitcoin at the times that all of you had access to it? How funny that a bunch of former poor people enjoy talking down to current poor people for not having access to or knowledge of the things that made you not poor. 

I currently have 0.00518 bitcoin. I get to own half of one ""bit-cent"". Even if it's value increases 20× (in USD) I'll only get enough of a return to make a down payment on a shitty used economy car. That's the amount of bitcoin I have access to. I have equity in other things and don't just piss away the little money I earn, so I'm not just riding on my half of a bitcent to make my fortune. 

I can't help but wonder how nice it must be sitting on that impossibly high throne that the lot of you were given a spot on merely by chance, looking down on the rest of us broke people with contempt. I hope your precious bitcoin hits 0 so you all can remember what it's like counting physical coins to buy necessities, instead of lecturing us on how we ""buy it at the price we deserve"". 

I'm of course not speaking to the other less than fortunate people on this sub, and no I don't feel like the world owes me something because I was born poor. I've accepted where I am. I just wish that people who owned whole coins or even lots of coins could hear themselves and what a little bit of money has done to them.",3498939,"No, you don't buy bitcoin at the price you deserve.",0,0.27,2021-11-01 17:03:41,NEGATIVE,0.965913712978363

I am part of a web design company and we provide online services to clients.

Most of our clients usually pay by paypal.

We have seen a significant increase in customers asking the possibility of paying for services in cryptocurrencies.

We don't and we don't have a clue if it's logical or not..but considering recent trends, we understand at least the importance of starting to consider.

The question will be: would this type of implementation be logical for a service that generates a limited volume of business?

Would it be logical to sell a product for a cryptocurrency that is worth X today and Y tomorrow?

If yes, any suggestions for implementation? Would it have logic to receive the payments through BitPay, CoinBase or Kraken? Any easy way to start with?

The only thing preventing someone from not being able to look into your safe is that there are so many that it would be unprobable for him to find it. 


I think this is kind of silly. Firstly. You can't calculate the probability with a perfect case scenario where your RNG generating your wallet will be perfect. RNG will definitely be imperfect and some seeds will get re-generated, some will never get generated. 


A pretty low number of people use bitcoin so yea, getting someone's address is not probable in the grand scope. But it is not impossible. 

If wallets had passwords, then people would have actual ownership of them. Like this it is just a numbers game, and I don't like it. Imagine someone with a quantum computer bruteforcing all wallets and getting all the money. It is possible. 


If anyone can give me a response that will satisfy me, please do. Maybe I misunderstood something. But this kind of system feels pretty stupid, not gonna lie. Imagine if the banking system worked like that. Literally nobody would use it.

 im 22m and I live with my mom (we don’t have any family here in Canada is just us 2 hence why I’m still living with her) recently my mom was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer this has devastated me and my family ( family back home ) .

Yesterday she had an appointment we thought it was nothing just a regular check up like she’s been doing for the past 2 months…oh boy was I wrong the doctors told her cold blooded that she only has about 2 months left of life I really don’t know what to do she covers mostly the rent I can’t really afford the rent only about half ($650) she’s been paying half and I pay half but due to her illness she stopped working and can’t go back.

I do home renovations for a living (under the books) is just me and my boss we had work up until recently when we finished a basement everything dried up we don’t have homes to work currently(really really bad timing).

I am holding about $1200 worth of bitcoin I been hodling for a while we have about 2 months worth of rent money I wanna keep hodling this amount I have but it looks like I’m going to have to sell this bitcoin in order to pay rent after our resources run out.

Let me say that I own a lot of bitcoin and precious metals as that is part of my business.

There recently was a post knocking Peter Schiff (once again lol), and one of the comments mentioned Peter's dad Irwin and the legal battles he had (and lost) with the IRS, and how he ultimately suffered and died from mostly untreated cancer during his last incarceration. The poster thought that was funny.

Living through that injustice drove Peter into escaping government control by moving to the tax haven Puerto Rico and creating a bank and a business based on fighting the USD fiat dominance using gold and silver, which were the ONLY options back then and indeed they were and still are a hedge against fiat inflation. So please forgive him if he can't make the leap to comprehending that there is no value in something that cannot be held in the hand, which brings me to to the thesis of my title.

If you are a long-term hodler of bitcoin as I am and think about what bitcoin is, which is cryptographic numbers on an immutable electronic ledger supported ONLY by the energy it takes to hash blocks and verify transactions, and you are honest with yourself you will realize that it is only the combined trust of all bitcoin holders, large and small that keeps bitcoin alive and well. Take away that trust, or take away the energy needed to sustain the blockchain and we have a problem Houston.

The presumption of unlimited energy is the Achilles heel of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. If we reach peak energy or governments manufacture climate change FUD, driving up energy costs and triggering rolling blackouts to ""save the planet"", etc. crypto will be the first thing to go, the hidden agenda being the elite's fear of losing the dollar denominated world they currently control.

However small, there is a possibility this could happen which is why I hedge with gold, silver, food, water, guns and ammo, etc., in an attempt to keep me and mine as safe as possible in almost any scenario.

I am not suggesting that you sell your BTC to buy gold and silver, but perhaps there is room in your wallet to prepare for other eventualities as we all do in every other area of life such as buy insurance, see doctors and dentists, send our kids to college, etc.",3552054,Gold and Silver as a Hedge Against Bitcoin....,0,1.0,2021-11-13 18:02:48,POSITIVE,0.9955174326896667

Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Miami Locals to Receive Bitcoin Dividends:** Mayor Suarez urges Miami residents to participate in the bitcoin boom. The city is offering a bitcoin dividend to people who open a digital wallet. Mayor Suarez announced the move on CoinDesk TV, adding that Miami previously launched its cryptocurrency, MiamiCoin. It is developed on the Stacks platform, which will be used to distribute bitcoin dividends to inhabitants. Additionally, the city is giving bitcoin revenue generated by staking the MiamiCoin to local people. Although MiamiCoin was just introduced in August, the city's staking activity has already generated more than $20 million. Staking is how token holders pledge their assets for a certain length of time in exchange for a return.

**AMC Theaters to Accept Bitcoin Payments:** AMC Theaters announced that customers would be able to pay for movie tickets and refreshments with bitcoin before the end of the year. AMC does not want to accept just Bitcoin; it also intends to accept Ethereum as well. With the help of a partnership with BitPay, AMC began accepting bitcoins as payment for gift cards in October of last year. According to the company, AMC runs 593 theatres in the United States and 335 theatres in foreign countries.

**Islamic Body in Indonesia Declares Bitcoin Haram:** According to reports, the National Ulema Council (MUI), Indonesia's highest Islamic intellectual organization, has declared cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin haram or banned under Islamic teachings. The MIU considered Bitcoin as part of its work on the Ulama Fatwa Commission, which is tasked with addressing some of Indonesia's most pressing social, political, economic, and legal challenges through the perspective of Islamic law. According to reports, while the MIU is a government-funded body, the council's most recent decision is not legally enforceable. Despite the MUI's admission that the fatwa is not Indonesian legislation, some sources assert that it may be utilized as a source of ""legislative inspiration."" Indonesia's government has chosen a split position on cryptocurrency legislation. Despite imposing a blanket ban on cryptocurrency payments in 2017, local governments have decided to maintain legality for crypto trading.

**SEC Rejects VanEck's Bitcoin ETF:** In a judgment announced on Friday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected investment company VanEck's petition for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The agency previously postponed a decision on the request until September. Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed Friday that it had rejected a VanEck-managed bitcoin exchange-traded fund that would have tracked the digital currency's price movements directly. The CBOE BZX Exchange applied in March, requesting that the SEC amend its rules to list the VanEck bitcoin fund. The SEC said that the CBOE had not done enough to establish its ability to safeguard investors from fraudulent trading.

**Bitcoin ATM Robbed by Thieves in Barcelona:** According to local media reports on Friday, Spanish police are probing the heist of a 'bitcoin ATM' during a raid on a cryptocurrency trading shop in a posh Barcelona neighbourhood. Customers may acquire bitcoin using cash or a debit card at Bitcoin ATMs. Some even enable users to convert their crypto holdings for cash. According to the Coin ATM monitoring website statistics, Spain has 158 such machines, the most in Europe. According to the EFE news agency, burglars stole the bitcoin ATM from a business on Beethoven Street in the Sarria neighbourhood, home to a GBTC cryptocurrency exchange branch.

**Tim Cook Confirms He Owns Bitcoin:** During a speech at the New York Times' Dealbook conference, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that he had invested his funds in Bitcoin. Although Cook acknowledged his bitcoin investment, he was far more cautious regarding Apple's future goals as a corporation. He ruled out investing its cash position in cryptocurrencies. In addition, he said that Apple has no imminent intentions to enable users to use it to purchase its goods. However, without elaborating, the CEO hinted that ""there are other things that we're looking at"" in terms of cryptocurrencies.

**Bitcoin's Hashrates Experience a Spike:** Bitcoin's hashrate was hovering at 157 EH/s. The network is supported by about 14 recognized mining pools. Stealth miners are mining 16.39 exahash or 10.24 percent of the network, and the hashrate is classed as ""unknown."" The unknown hashrate reflects the network's fifth-largest mining 'pool.' Meanwhile, Bitcoin's hashrate has increased in perfect sync with Bitcoin's upward price movement during the previous three months. Overall hashrate is up 42% from three months ago, around a month following China's restriction on bitcoin miners. Hashrate averages for the previous three months indicate that Bitcoin's hashrate reached as high as 180 EH/s at times during that time. Since October 25, Bitcoin's hashrate has soared three times over the 180 EH/s mark.",3556431,Summary of Interesting Bitcoin Articles from Last Week,0,1.0,2021-11-14 17:43:35,POSITIVE,0.8818683624267578

However my outbound transaction is still sitting in the wallet showing the following.

Taproot is the biggest upgrade of Bitcoin in recent years. This upgrade will not only greatly improve the privacy and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions, but also further release the potential of smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pslkao5npz71.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aac27ff18c5d2b3225c69d65354c6ccba698043

**What is Taproot?**

Taproot is a soft fork that improves Bitcoin’s scripts to increase privacy and improve upon other factors related to complex transactions. Transactions on the Bitcoin network can use various features that make them more complex, including timelock releases, multi-signature requirements, and others.

**Upgrade content**

The Taproot upgrade includes three independent Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP): BIP340, BIP341, and BIP342. It further improves the security and privacy of the base layer, and on this basis allows more complex applications to be built.

BIP340: Replace Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with Schnorr signature. 

BIP341：Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST).

BIP342: Reform of Bitcoin's scripting language through 'Tapscript'.

**Schnorr signature**

Schnorr signatures consist of a cryptographic signature scheme developed by Claus Schnorr – a German mathematician and cryptographer. Even though Schnorr had his algorithm protected under a patent for many years, the patent officially expired in 2008. Among a number of benefits, Schnorr signatures are primarily known for their simplicity and efficiency in generating short signatures.

One of the main advantages of Schnorr signatures is that they’re able to take multiple keys inside a complex Bitcoin transaction and produce a single unique signature. This means that the signatures from the multiple parties involved in the transaction can be “aggregated” into a single Schnorr signature. This is known as signature aggregation.

**Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST)**

Taproot uses Schnorr to create Merkelized Alternative Script Trees (MAST, a data structure that combines abstract syntax trees and Merkel trees). In the previous situation, suppose we have a transaction. The conditions for this transaction are that user A can use the transaction 30 days before the transaction is initiated, and user B can use the transaction 30 days after the transaction is initiated. In the end, no matter who uses the transaction, the information of users A and B will be exposed, which is obviously unnecessary. 

In MAST, only the user who used the transaction will be exposed, while the information of another user will be hidden, which greatly protects the user's privacy.

**TapScript**

BIP 342 is about the specific content of Taproot script implementation. It adds some opcodes for execution and deployment of Taproot, Schnorr, soft fork and other code-level functions, such as ""OP\_CHECKSIGADD"". Inefficient opcodes such as ""OP\_CHECKMULTISIG"" and ""OP\_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY"" are disabled. Revised ""OP\_CHECKSIG"" and ""OP\_CHECKSIGVERIFY"" to provide Schnorr functions. The content of the Bitcoin script has been improved as a whole to adapt to the Taproot upgrade.

**Closing thoughts**

Taproot may be the most important upgrade in the history of Bitcoin, and it will create the purest cryptocurrency in history - the currency that utilizes cryptography to its extreme, lightest weight and most tenacious vitality. This is an opportunity to redefine Bitcoin. Whether it is a miner, a developer or a full node, it will prove that Bitcoin is still thriving.

Bitcoin is INCREDIBLY revolutionary. Bitcoin is the first asset in the history of mankind that has a real total supply. It can not be counterfeited. It can not be printed out of thin air. It is deflationary.

Gold doesn’t have a known supply. Silver doesn’t have a known supply.
Diamonds don’t have a known supply.

All those assets and their supply are manipulated and managed by huge institutions. 

This is just one of the reasons why Bitcoin is succeeding.

Bitcoin:

is DECENTRALIZED
is SECURE
is OPEN SOURCE
is FAST
is PRIVATE
is DEFLATIONARY
has LOW TRANSACTION FEES
has a MAX supply of 21 million

Inflation numbers were much higher than what was to be expected and the market began to sell off rapidly. At the same time bitcoin saw its price jump to all time highs, Signaling that people view Bitcoin as a source of refuge.  

I think it was kind of the opposite of reaction to what should happen. Bitcoin is more a hedge against monetary devaluation than just inflation. Yes inflation will cheapen the dollar but in the short term, it will probably cause the FED to tighten which will strengthen the dollar. Long term, the dollar is on shaky grounds and the what ever the policy the FED chooses to curve inflation will not be substantial enough to stop it. 

I think this is partially why bitcoin came back to earth towards the evening. That and futures contracts being liquidated on both sides.

The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered on 18 August 2008.

On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.

Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as an open-source code and released it in January 2009. Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.

On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"". This note references a headline published by The Times and has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.

The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto. Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold.

In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000.

Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010, when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation.

📷

After early ""proof-of-concept"" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting 9.9 million in bitcoins, worth about $214 million.

The price rose to $31.50 on 8 June. Within a month the price fell to $11.00. The next month it fell to $7.80, and in another month to $4.77.

In 2011, the price started at $0.30 per bitcoin, growing to $5.27 for the year.

On 1 November 2011, the reference implementation Bitcoin-Qt version 0.5.0 was released. It introduced a front end that used the Qt user interface toolkit. The software previously used Berkeley DB for database management. Developers switched to LevelDB in release 0.8 in order to reduce blockchain synchronization time.

The Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin's development and uptake.

In October 2012, BitPay reported having over 1,000 merchants accepting bitcoin under its payment processing service.

In March 2013 the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with different rules due to a bug in version 0.8 of the bitcoin software. The two blockchains operated simultaneously for six hours, each with its own version of the transaction history from the moment of the split. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software, selecting the backward-compatible version of the blockchain. As a result, this blockchain became the longest chain and could be accepted by all participants, regardless of their bitcoin software version. During the split, the Mt. Gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the price dropped by 23% to $37 before recovering to the previous level of approximately $48 in the following hours.

The update to this release resulted in a minor blockchain fork on the 11 March 2013. The fork was resolved shortly afterward. Seeding nodes through IRC was discontinued in version 0.8.2. From version 0.9.0 the software was renamed to Bitcoin Core.

The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for ""decentralized virtual currencies"" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as Money Service Businesses (MSBs), that are subject to registration or other legal obligations.

The bitcoin price rose to $259 on 10 April, but then crashed by 83% to $45 over the next three days.

In April, exchanges BitInstant and Mt. Gox experienced processing delays due to insufficient capacity resulting in the bitcoin price dropping from $266 to $76 before returning to $160 within six hours.

On 15 May 2013, US authorities seized accounts associated with Mt. Gox after discovering it had not registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN in the US.

On 23 June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration listed ₿11.02 as a seized asset in a United States Department of Justice seizure notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoin.

The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from the dark web website Silk Road, following the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht. These bitcoins were sold at blind auction by the United States Marshals Service to venture capital investor Tim Draper.

On 30 November 2013, the price reached $1,163 before starting a long-term crash, declining by 87% to $152 in January 2015.

On 5 December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoins. After the announcement, the value of bitcoins dropped, and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services. Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009.

In 2013, prices started at $13.30 rising to $770 by 1 January 2014.

On 30 July 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation started accepting donations of bitcoin.

HSBC refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin.

In 2014, the National Australia Bank closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin.

Release 0.10 of the software was made public on 16 February 2015. It introduced a consensus library which gave programmers easy access to the rules governing consensus on the network. In version, 0.11.2 developers added a new feature that allowed transactions to be made unspendable until a specific time in the future.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released on April 15, 2016 and enabled multiple soft forks to occur concurrently.

Around 100 contributors worked on Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 which was released on 23 August 2016.

In October 2016, Bitcoin Core’s 0.13.1 release featured the ""Segwit"" soft fork that included a scaling improvement aiming to optimize the bitcoin blocksize.

In 2015, prices started at $314 and rose to $434 for the year. In 2016, prices rose and climbed up to $998 by 1 January 2017.

On 15 July 2017, the controversial Segregated Witness \[SegWit\] software upgrade was approved (""locked in""). Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability.

On 21 July 2017, bitcoin was trading at $2,748, up 52% from 14 July 2017's $1,835.

Supporters of large blocks who were dissatisfied with the activation of SegWit forked the software on 1 August 2017 to create Bitcoin Cash.

SegWit was subsequently activated on the network on 24 August 2017. The bitcoin price rose almost 50% in the week following SegWit's approval.

On 10 December 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange started trading bitcoin futures.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange started trading bitcoin futures on 17 December 2017.

Prices started at $998 in 2017 and rose to $13,412.44 on 1 January 2018, after reaching its all-time high of $19,783.06 on 17 December 2017.

Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges, including thefts from Coincheck in January 2018, Coinrail and Bithumb in June, and Bancor in July. For the first six months of 2018, $761 million worth of cryptocurrencies was reported stolen from exchanges. Bitcoin's price was affected even though other cryptocurrencies were stolen at Coinrail and Bancor as investors worried about the security of cryptocurrency exchanges.

China banned trading in bitcoin, with the first steps taken in September 2017, and a complete ban that started on 1 February 2018.

Throughout the rest of the first half of 2018, bitcoin's price fluctuated between $11,480 and $5,848. On 1 July 2018, bitcoin's price was $6,343.

In September 2018, an anonymous party discovered and reported an invalid-block denial-of-server vulnerability to developers of Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin ABC, and Bitcoin Unlimited. Further analysis by bitcoin developers showed the issue could also allow the creation of blocks violating the 21 million coin limit and CVE-2018-17144 was assigned and the issue resolved.

The price on 1 January 2019 was $3,747, down 72% for 2018, and down 81% since the all-time high.

In February 2019, Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga Fintech Solutions failed with approximately $200 million missing.

By June 2019 the price had recovered to $13,000.

In September 2019 the Central Bank of Venezuela, at the request of PDVSA, ran tests to determine if bitcoin and ether could be held in central bank's reserves. The request was motivated by oil company's goal to pay its suppliers.

In September 2019 the Intercontinental Exchange (the owner of the NYSE) began trading of bitcoin futures on its exchange called Bakkt. Bakkt also announced that it would launch options on bitcoin in December 2019.

In December 2019, YouTube removed bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos, but later restored the content after judging they had ""made the wrong call.""

According to CoinMetrics and Forbes, on 11 March, 281,000 bitcoins were sold by owners who held them for only thirty days. This compared to 4,131 bitcoins that had laid dormant for a year or more indicating that the vast majority of the bitcoin volatility on that day was from recent buyers.

During the week of 11 March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken experienced an 83% increase in the amount of account signups over the week of bitcoin's price collapse, a result of buyers looking to capitalize on the low price.

On September 3, 2020, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange admitted in its Regulated Market the quotation of the first Bitcoin exchange-traded note (ETN), centrally cleared via Eurex Clearing.

In October 2020, PayPal announced that it would allow its users to buy and sell bitcoin on its platform, although not to deposit or withdraw bitcoins.

Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high of $19,850.11.

Bitcoin traded as high as $41,973.

Price briefly fell as much as 26% but pared losses to trade around $33,400.

Bitcoin price surge after Elon Musk and Tesla announcements of investments in the Bitcoin include acceptance of payment.

Bitcoin price reached ATH $50,000.

Bitcoin is back above $60,000 as Coinbase gets ready for a public debut.

Bitcoin price drops to $30,000 at one point following suggestions that Tesla has sold or will sell its Bitcoin holdings and a new set of regulations from the Chinese government to support their cryptocurrency crackdown.

On 1 June 2021, El Salvador President, Nayib Bukele announced his plans to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, this would render El Salvador the world's first country to do so.

On 8 June 2021, at the initiative of the president, pro-government deputies in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador voted legislation—Ley Bitcoin or the Bitcoin Law—to make Bitcoin legal tender in the country alongside the US Dollar.

I am a homeless loser living in my car who happens to have a decent amount of money ... Before you judge please read this post fully...

Starting with the Bitcoin Question:

Is it allowed to buy and sell Bitcoin every day? Like if the price drops to 60,000 and I want to buy it and then it goes up to 68,000 and I want to sell it... Can I do that multiple times a week? Yes I could lose out if it never drops and only goes up... but I see it always drops and goes back up... Or is this illegal or not allowed?

So my question is can I be banned from buying and selling or have a higher tax or get in trouble for buying and selling...? 

I want to only buy and sell Bitcoin and buy and hold for years the ""safe"" stocks like Google and Amazon and VOO and stuff like that that have only been going up the past 5 years... Because I heard you get 10 percent interest per year.

I do have a job ... $11 an hour crappy job... I do have savings.... Thousands.... I do live in my car.... No Family No Friends. I just have me, myself, and I... Maybe God or an Angel or two... And whoever can help me online.

I don't want to live my life living in my car saving $10,000 a year and NEVER retiring. So yeah I have some money but I don't feel like I will ever succeed without investing and getting a 10 percent return each year. Apparently if I invested $1000 a month for 10 years I can retire in with like $200,000 (In The Philippines NOT USA) but if I do that for 20 years it's more like $1,000,000.... Instead of working for 20 years and having $200,000 from work saving while living on my car) obviously I will make less if I get a home unless I get a better paying job.

I can invest $1000 in the stock market every single week. I am living in my car right now because I want to save money and retire someday. I have no friends and no family and I don't see any way of ever retiring if I just work a job that won't keep up with inflation, that I hate and that I will never really get anywhere.

I can have a $5000 Emergency Fund and invest $1000 a week in  Stock or crypto or whatever... Monthly Fees while in car are $400.

My actual goal is Saving $250,000 an retiring in the Philippines where most people make equal to $1 an hour at their jobs. It's really the only place I can see myself actually being able to retire and although I don't like their government so much the people are friendly and nice... I don't like most Americans because of various reasons even though we have a lot of money and freedom...

I need a $15 an hour job to be able to get a home and save $1000 a month. Right now $11 an hour can save $1000 a month with no home...

I kinda feel depressed but I want to keep trying as I see my money increase every day little by little but I fear maybe I will never have enough? 

Can you all give me some advice or hopefully words so I don't feel this is all for nothing... Like there is no meaning or purpose out there.....",3537152,Can I Buy And Sell Daily? Bitcoin on Robinhood. Homeless.,0,1.0,2021-11-10 18:37:15,NEGATIVE,0.9997208714485168

Disclaimer:not a finacial adviser.

I have an amount of Sats (parts of a bitcoin for those who aren't up to speed) nowhere near 1 BTC.

Around April 2021 I had a small ammount of cash and was looking for something to do with it.  No intention of BTC.

Then. I was talking to a friend who was already in the market,  I found out a cpuple of other friends had also got into crypto BTC and some other altcoins(shitcoins).

At this time the market was rising and approaching a ath(all time high).  I was reading about Bitcoin (dyr do your research)  and saw that a lot of people were waiting for a correction from the ath and there was a huge amount of fud (fear uncertainty doubt) in the media.

I waited and after a couple of more months invested my cash.  Compared to my friends I bought in at about 1/3 that they got in at.

Friends were trying to make quick cash and deffo joined due to fomo(fear of missing out).  My investment was part of a long game for spare cash when I retire.  

I dabbled with trying to make some quick gains,  funnily enough lost some cash. Luclily managed to break even.  

From August onwards I've been DCA (dollar cost averaging)  regardless of price.

My DCA is now around 35k which I happy with.

One of the big factors for BTC for me was the limited supply(21M) and halvening every 4 years or so.
So my aim is to get as may Sats a possible before I retire.

I'm all in for BTC also have other pensions,  but was looking at getting more BTC.  Ome option is to get a pwrsonal loan of 10k with 3% interest and buy more coin.  However. I could not bring myself to do that,  I could make repayments if it tanked,  but just couldn't pull the trigger.  I did get me thinking how to maximise my sats. . .

So I've ended up doing the following to complement the DCA.  I have a credit card with 0% on purchases for 2 1/2 years.  I buy everything I can with this.  I then put that ammount I would have spent in fiat into BTC.  I round up the ammount so I will get some spare Sats once I clear the card. This works for me as if things tank I can clear the credit card debt, but hopefully will make my cash work for me.

So I will sell some of my coin in 2 years to pay the card off.  I will also keep DCA for long term gains.

Just a bit of info for others.

This sound money world you and your partner live in under your own personal bitcoin standard also makes everything exponentially easier to achieve every year that passes.

The people will now prefer hard money to weak money like the American dollar.

The people will now prefer a decentralized, leaderless system to a centralized system that puts all the power in the hands of a minority of people who have been happily abusing it for decades.

The people will choose a system that respects privacy over a system of surveillance that will become even more pervasive with the planned implementation of CBDCs in the coming years.

The people will prefer a system that allows them to verify at any moment what the truth is rather than a system that has disappointed them for decades because of the abuse of the humans who run it, whether central bankers or private bankers.

The people will prefer a system that gives them the freedom to live their lives on their own terms rather than a system that tends to oppress them.

Finally, the people will favor a system that places them fully in the world of the future where everything will be digital rather than an outdated system that is unjust and cannot evolve due to the unwillingness of the powerful who run it to lose their unjust privileges.

So I sent the funds back to mother in laws Trezor, successfully.

I saved the address to the wallets and WIPED my empty father in laws Trezor and successfully set it up, (this time collecting all seed words). 

I SENT THE CRYPTO to his old address that was wiped and I don’t have the seed words to!!

Im not a fan of diversification and my whole portfolio right now is 100% P.dot. It's been this way for some months and I am now in good profit.  
Trouble is, the P.dot hype as of today is pretty much gone. The auctions have been announced, now live and the price will probably continue to rise slowly with more and more auctions, so it's still a pretty good call in my opinion, BUT, since this is my first ever bull market I am having seconds thoughts.

I don't want to speculate on exact prices, just need more info and advice on how to play this.  
From my undestranding, if BTC does 3x from now (lets say 180k) at the market peak, large cap Alts are supposed to be doing 3-6x, or something like this, right?  
Timing. BTC goes first, then it sort of cools off and all that money flows back into Alts, creating what we call Alt season, right?  
This is what I've learned so far, but there are still some things Im unsure of.

1. We are expecting a huge supply shock, driving the BTC price above what we expect, so, how would that affect alts, where we won't experience that supply shock? I know they are supposed to bleed against BTC at first and catch on later, is that still supposed to happen?
2. The blow-off top. Looking at the charts, the BTC ATH and Alts ATH most of the times match perfectly. Meaning, when BTC suddenly drops, so do the alts, but drop more. When exactly is this cool off in BTC price, making the alt season?
3. I know nothing here is a financial advice, but would you suggest switching my DOT to BTC for the next 2-3 months? I keep looking at the DOT/BTC chart it doesn't look like a good idea, but that supply shock on Alts is still a question to me.

Thanks in advance to whoever has enough will to clarify those things for me.

Here are three key differences between them that investors should know.

History: Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and has a larger market cap than Ethereum, which was only created in 2015.

Purpose: Whereas Bitcoin is loved by the financial community and is seen as an alternative to traditional money, the purpose of Ethereum is also technology. Ethereum plays a big role in smart contracts that are used by companies around the world.

Supply: There’s a limited supply of Bitcoin, which is capped at 21 million. Ethereum has no limited supply.

Final Thoughts: Despite their differences, both Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have experienced tremendous growth in the past year.

Disclosing the location of your seed to family members or friends is a security risk. Ideally you would only make this disclosure once you are disceased. 

In thinking about a solution to this problem, I came up with the following idea, and would be interested to know what others think of it. Are there potential vulnerabilites that I'm overlooking?  


My idea would be the deployment of a basic web script , written in php or similar. 

The script would send an SMS message if the current unix time was equal to or greater than a pre-defined timestamp. 

The payload of the SMS would contain encrypted instructions detailing the location of a BTC seed.

The target of the SMS would be the number of a burner cell phone. 

Once the script is in place, on some webhosting that is sufficiently paid up, in advance, the burner phone along with an encryption key / decryption instructions would be given to an heir / next of kin. 

While still alive, one would periodically amend the scripts pre-defined unix timestamp, pushing it back by, say, a month, each time...

If for whatever reason one was unable to amended this timestamp (ie one is deceased), the script would eventually execute, delivering the encrypted instruction payload to the next of kin, who are personally equipped to decypher it and act upon it.

The purpose of the burner phone is to obscure the identity of the next of kin, if the script source code were to be compromised.

A few international stories included in this weeks roundup!

**El Salvador to Build a Bitcoin City:** El Salvador has said that it intends to construct the world's first ""Bitcoin City."" President Nayib Bukele recently revealed that the City would be built in the eastern part of La Union, fueled by a neighbouring volcano. El Salvador became the first nation in the world to legalize bitcoin in September. For more than two decades, the nation has been denominated in US dollars. The nation intends to use a $1 billion tokenized bond to finance the City's building and infrastructure for bitcoin mining. The City's only tax will be a 10% value-added tax to assist finance development and future expenses.

**IMF Warns El Salvador Against Using Bitcoin as a Legal Tender:** Bitcoin ""should not be utilized as legal money"" in El Salvador, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ""Given Bitcoin's exceptional volatility, its use as legal tender raises serious concerns regarding financial regulation, fiscal responsibility, and economic stability,"" according to IMF specialists. ""Additionally, its utilization results in contingent obligations on the budget. Bitcoin should not be utilized as legal money due to these issues."" While the IMF staff lauded El Salvador's economic progress and financial inclusion, they emphasized that the nation should enhance regulation and monitoring of its new payment ecosystem to address consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism funding concerns.

**Norway is Considering Banning Bitcoin Mining, Laos Embraces it:** Following China's lead, Norway may be the next nation to crack down severely on Bitcoin mining activities. The Nordic nation has raised the alarm about the possible environmental effect of cryptocurrency mining. According to Euronews Next, Norway, which became a popular location for miners during the massive China exodus, is also contemplating implementing a ban on Bitcoin mining. However, while Norway is attempting to ban crypto mining, a Southeast Asian government is implementing regulations that seem to be pro-Bitcoin. Laos, a debt-ridden nation, is attempting to capitalize on the cryptocurrency business by enacting new legislation governing crypto mining and exchange activity.

**Michael Saylor Impersonator Steals Almost $4 Million in Bitcoin:** In a giveaway scam, an imposter masquerading as MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor was able to dupe victims of nearly $4 million. The scammer posed as the firm's pro-Bitcoin CEO on a website. He then requested that site users contribute some Bitcoin to a specific address, promising to double the amount for them. To accelerate the progress of general bitcoin acceptance, we have decided to host a 5 000 BTC giveaway,"" the bogus website stated. As of now, the scammer's address had received over 80 BTC from 50 transactions totalling over $4.5 million.

**Stripe is Reconsidering Adopting Bitcoin as a Payment Option:** Stripe is reconsidering the possibility of integrating cryptocurrencies as a payment method in the future, according to co-founder John Collison. Previously, the company discontinued support for Bitcoin payments in 2018, citing the currency's high volatility and inefficiency for everyday transactions. Collison said that although the corporation is not yet prepared to state definitively that it is ready to begin crypto acceptance, it is still a possibility that might materialize in the future. Previously, the online payment processor with a $94 billion market cap discontinued service for Bitcoin payments after the 2018 market fall. Officially, the asset's volatility and hefty costs during periods of heavy network traffic were cited as reasons.

**Kazakhstan Plans to Use Nuclear Power for Bitcoin Mining:** Kazakhstan is pondering nuclear energy to solve power grid concerns caused by the flood of Bitcoin miners into the nation after China's cryptocurrency ban. Kazakhstan's domestic power usage increased by 8% in 2021, a rise ascribed to the entrance of Chinese Bitcoin miners. Increased usage has resulted in a substantial imbalance in the power system, resulting in inconsistent power supply and unstable electrical services, exacerbating the local population's problems. According to IP data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, Kazakhstan is second in the world for Bitcoin mining power control, after the United States, with an 18.1 percent share of the global hash rate.

**Morgan Stanley Adds More Bitcoin:** Morgan Stanley's investment funds boosted their exposure to Bitcoin by purchasing shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. The Morgan Stanley Insight Fund boosted its holdings in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, or GBTC, shares by more than 63%, from 928,051 in the second quarter of 2021 to 1,520,549 as of Sept. 30. Morgan Stanley seems to be sinking its toes further into the crypto world, whether indirectly via Grayscale or directly through its endorsement of blockchain platforms. In September, the business announced that it will establish a crypto-focused research branch to examine the ""increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in global markets.""

**Bitcoin Overtakes Paypal in Terms of Value Transferred:** According to Blockdata's marketing study, ""When might the Bitcoin network process volumes comparable to Mastercard and Visa?"" The Bitcoin network processed around $489 billion per quarter on average in 2021. PayPal, in comparison, averaged roughly $302 billion every quarter over the same time. Mastercard's network handled an average of $1.8 trillion each quarter over the same period, whereas Visa's network processed an average of $3.2 trillion per quarter. As the data indicates, Bitcoin now processes around 27% of what Mastercard processes each quarter and approximately 15% of what Visa processes.

**Fintonia Launches Two Bitcoin Funds in Singapore:** To meet the growing demand for digital asset funds, Singapore-based fund manager Fintonia Group has launched two institutional-grade funds tracking the performance of Bitcoin. Fintonia Bitcoin Physical Fund and Fintonia Secured Yield Fund are two new products launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore-regulated financial services organization (MAS). Fintonia Bitcoin Physical Fund is intended for institutional investors seeking direct exposure to bitcoin. This implies the company will acquire Bitcoin directly rather than a derivative instrument based on the cryptocurrency. By contrast, the Fintonia Backed Yield Fund is designed for investors seeking access to private loans secured by Bitcoin.",3610341,Summaries of Bitcoin Articles from Last Week,0,1.0,2021-11-28 16:26:35,NEGATIVE,0.9502102136611938

These are just some of the economies that have been hit hardest by border closures. 

At the same time many regular people around the world have lost jobs and if they managed to keep their job inflatiion is currently erroding the amount of money they have available to spend on tourism. Bitcoin and crypto holders however have seen their networth increase 15x (1,500%) since March 2020.

Because of this bitcoin holders have become a desired tourism cohort that countries want to attract because they have money to spend.

Bitcoiners love travel but they dislike banks. Therefore the only thing countries need to do to attract bitcoiners to their shore is to make it easy for them to travel without needing a bank or bank card.

Bitcoiners want to be able to travel to a destination with nothing but a crypto wallet, they do not want to rely on any form of bank or bank card. 

In cash based societies like Thailand this can be easily achieved by making every ATM also accept bitcoin for cash without any identity requirements. In the same way I can walk up to an ATM with a card and get cash I should be able to walk up to an ATM with a bitcoin wallet and get cash. This one change would make Thailand extremely desirable to bitcoin tourists.

In resort based societies like the Maldives all that needs to happen is to allow for hotel bills to be settled with bitcoin. So allow hotels to accept bitcoin as legal tender and help provide them with exchange services to allow this.

In advanced societies like Dubai making bitcoin legal tender and following similar steps to El Salvador would be the way to go. The department of technology could develop a lightning point of sale app for use by businesses where sats are converted to AED dirhams and deposited into a specified bank account.

I have a question regarding selling and capital gain tax at a centralized exchange (coinbase). I want to pay my fair share of tax and  I have enrolled into the coinbase KYC and tax register.

Let's say I bought/earned in total 3 BTCs. 

I bought the first 1 BTC 1.2 years ago

I bought the second 1 BTC 0.9 years ago. I transfer them to a lending platform that earn me 0.1 BTC

I bought the last 0.9 BTC 1 day ago. 

So in total, I have 3 BTCs-----2.9 bought, 0.1 earned-----and I have transfer all of them back to coinbase today.

&amp;#x200B;

And I decided to sell 1.5 BTC today. Can I pick which 1.5 BTC I sell?

Of course I want to see the 1 BTC from 1.2 years ago-----for long term capital gain tax

and 0.5 BTC I from 1 day ago----almost have no price change, no capital gain tax. 

&amp;#x200B;

But will the coinbase or any exchange sell my BTC in that way? I know in stock exchange at CS, I can pick which exactly stock to sell according to purache time, but I don't the similar function at Coinbase or another other centralized exchange.

People with access to their BTC will be able to transfer their BTC to a new wallet with the new security standard to protect against quantum computers.

However, the 'lost' BTC will be in wallets built on old protocols that'll be susceptible to quantum computers. The BTC in those old wallets will likely be 'hacked' by quantum computers and stolen. Effectively, re-mining them back into circulation.

Maybe I’m missing something. Also, apologies if this is axiomatic and my dumb arse didn’t figure this out sooner.

Is HODLing the way to go? Buying Bitcoin and locking it away to never see the light of day doesn’t seem like a great strategy unless you’re just hoping the price goes higher. Maybe for Bitcoin to go “Super Saiyan” is to start using it? Imagine Apple declared that they would accept Bitcoin as payment and nothing else (even USD), then people who wanted Apple products would HAVE to get Bitcoin in order get their Apple stuff. Irrespective of whether “Bitcoin has value” or not (note the inverted commas). Which go me thinking. Maybe we as Bitcoiners have the power to give Bitcoin value by using it as a currency. After all, if people wanted what you were selling and the only way to get it was to buy Bitcoins, then velocity of money would pick up and the Bitcoin network would achieve the critical mass it needs in order to be taken seriously. Then once it reaches that point, governments couldn’t ban it because there’s (potentially) too much money to be made via taxation. So maybe better to work with it, rather than fight it.

Anyway, please disseminate this idea as maybe I’m missing something. But maybe USING Bitcoin would have more value rather than HODLing Bitcoin?

If someone, who is ~40 years old, who has accumulated decent wealth in fiat (through earnings, stocks/Mutual funds, inheritance etc) and got to know about bitcoin only now. He has decided to put a percentage of his networth (excluding real estate) in crypto. What should be his investment strategy? 

Strategy 1: On one extreme, with his experience in stocks, he knows very well that ""time is the market is more important than timing the market"". So just put the decided amount, move to hardware wallet and be done with it. With increase in networth (through earnings, appreciation etc), invest more regularly. That's enough.

Strategy 2: On the other extreme, he has decided a sum to be invested every day, which will last for next 20 months. This utilise the high volatility and will average out the price. This is how he built his mutual fund wealth over years (thro SIP). 

Strategy 3:  Best of both worlds: Invest 50% now and SIP the rest, next 10 months.

Strategy 4: A bit complicated. Split the amount into 12 chunks. Invest a chunk for every 5% drop from ATH. Ie..now market is around  20% down from ATH. Invest 4 chunks and leave it. If market falls more, invest rest based on percentage fall. (Ie..ATH is 69k. Invest one chunk everytime market touches 65k, 62k, 58k, 55k, 51k, 48k, 41k, 37k, 34k, 31k, 27k). And continue daily SIP, till money allocated to crypto last. If market never goes to 51k from here but touches new ATH, revise these numbers again. .(But first 4 chunks are done. Invest next chunk only if market is down 25% from new ATH. Also, with daily SIP, if 5th chunk is invested, wait for 30% correction to invest 6th chunk). This way, he doesn't miss major drops and at the same stacking sats every day.

So — very open-ended question, but how can the relationship between the crypto community and conservation groups be strengthened/built? What would it be about a conservation org that would make you want to donate + work/partner with them?

I’m a huge believer in the power of innovative tech and defi in the climate fight, and also have the opportunity to implement bitcoin-relevant programs/pathways into the org. Would absolutely love to hear your thoughts/ideas/comments.

That said, there are many people who are looking to get exposure into Bitcoin, safely, without needing to purchase a hardware wallet and/or worry about storing private keys/wallet seeds. Below, I'll be explaining a way of getting exposure without much risk.

**Please note I'm a Canadian resident, and I'm not sure if there's an equivalent way of getting BTC exposure in the US and/or other countries.**

**Method:** Bitcoin ETF

Bitcoin ETFs were released earlier this year and can be considered an attractive option to users who are new to Bitcoin. A Bitcoin ETF mimics the price of Bitcoin and allows investors to buy into the ETF without going through the complex process of buying and storing Bitcoin itself. 

One of the popular Bitcoin ETFs here in Canada is BTCC.B ([https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-bitcoin-etf](https://www.purposeinvest.com/funds/purpose-bitcoin-etf))

A common argument I've seen against using Bitcoin ETFs is the fact that ""paper Bitcoin"" can dangerously affect Bitcoin's value. To address that concern, the following info is found on the front page of the BTCC.B ETF linked above:

&gt;Physically settled and safely held in cold storage  
This isn’t just a claim to paper like Bitcoin futures, it’s the real deal. When you buy the ETF, we buy real Bitcoin with your money. By holding this ETF, you hold actual Bitcoin in your portfolio.

Furthermore, the ETF is sold on regulated brokerage platforms with access to the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) protection if the brokerage becomes insolvent: [https://www.cipf.ca/](https://www.cipf.ca/)

If something happens to the fund itself (BTCC.B), my understanding is that your shares would get liquidated to Canadian dollars instead, aka you'd get money back based on how many shares you owned. I could be wrong on this part, so please correct me (with evidence) if this is wrong.

So what does all of the above mean? It means that Canadians have a safe and easy way to get exposure into Bitcoin via ETFs, while also being protected by CIPF, and without negatively influencing the value of Bitcoin since real Bitcoin is bought for each share purchased (with BTCC.B).

As a final remark, I'm not against hardware wallets; I think they're a great option, especially when you're familiar enough with how Bitcoin works. However, we need to be realistic and consider the safest way for people (aging population, non-tech savvy users) to get exposure, and in my opinion, that's by using ETFs.",3598935,[GUIDE] A safe way to get exposure to BTC as a Canadian resident,0,1.0,2021-11-25 07:37:23,POSITIVE,0.9560456871986389

If he enters a transation to send bitcoin from his wallet to my wallet, he uses his private key, his public key and my public key. The miners toss the transaction in their block, hash for it, validate it, present it to the nodes, done. The way I understand it an ""evil"" miner wouldnt be able to change my receiving public address to his own public address to ""re-route"" my buddies bitcoin, since to do that he needs a fully valid transaction which consists of a valid sender private key, a valid sender public key and a valid receiver public key - and the miner doesnt have my buddies private key.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the question is - if my buddy uses exodus, or the ledger software or any other type of software (which i guess he has to use SOME kind of software) to enter the transaction, could technically the software developer somehow change the receiving address and present the entire transaction as valid since they have my buddies private key IN their software (since he entered it when entering he transaction)?

Although Bitcoin is currently developing well and out of the circle is stronger than ever, Bitcoin is advancing in the direction of strengthening safe-haven assets and digital gold. Although the volatility of Bitcoin's market has made the value storage method questionable, its profitability, international payment, constant quantity and other characteristics have established value support for Bitcoin. However, from the point of view of practical application value, Bitcoin really cannot be compared with the new generation network represented by Ethereum. Bitcoin is like a stand-alone game. Ethereum has expanded the scope of games and derives a larger application ecosystem. Therefore, in terms of application value, Ethereum is an upgrade of Bitcoin, so Ethereum naturally has a higher Value. Although both Bitcoin and Ethereum currently restrict the expansion of application scenarios due to network congestion, ""BTC congestion is due to unwillingness to expand, and ETH is due to reaching the upper limit of computer hardware performance"" (Jiang Zhuoer). From the perspective of application development, Ethereum currently has established a financial application system with Defi as its core and is widely adopted by the mainstream society, while Bitcoin is only hovering on BTC as a single asset and cannot move forward. From this point of view alone, the value of BTC has fallen behind that of ETH. More importantly, in the face of congestion, Ethereum has started the 2.0 upgrade-expansion, with the goal of solving application restrictions caused by network congestion. Therefore, Ethereum has the practical value of long-term sustainable development, which will inevitably promote the development of Ethereum's market and market value. Ethereum developer Evan Van Ness tweeted: ETH is 50% technology, 30% finance and 20% religious belief; BTC is 7% technology, 3% finance and 90% religious belief. Make wise choices. When ideology is far greater than the value of technology and application, it will face a more dangerous collapse risk. Therefore, Evan Van Ness is actually explaining more long-term safe investment conditions. However, the pioneering significance of Bitcoin itself is far greater than its application value. It has established a special industry position for Bitcoin, and digital gold and bulk payments are sufficient to support the long-term value of Bitcoin. However, whether BTC can always maintain the No. 1 market value is worth pondering. According to Merkaf's law: the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. With the increasing ""number of active addresses"", Ethereum clearly has more value for market value growth. In particular, the development of Defi finance, the increasing adoption of Ethereum, and the larger-scale applications that may appear after the arrival of 2.0 will attract more users to Ethereum. This is the biggest reason why Jiang Zhuoer predicted that the market value of Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin!",3572480,Will the value of ETH surpass BTC?,0,1.0,2021-11-18 04:19:55,POSITIVE,0.8652645349502563

Youre clearly investing solely off his predictions if you feel the need to curse him out and start crying over a 9.5% dip over a 2 day period. He hasn't even be proven wrong yet haha. Here's a tip, next time you make an investment, do your own TA. Chill the fuck out.

Secondly, TA isn't bullshit just because it didn't work in your favour. TA is your best friend when it's right 70% of the time but when we get a dip it's ""bullshit""? No. If that's how you feel about TA you're clearly new to investing and shouldn't even be concerned with the short term outlook of Bitcoin anyway because you shouldn't be trading it, you should just be learning about it and holding. Chill the fuck out.

Thirdly, the way some of you are posting made me think we dropped 50-60% haha, I open up my trading view app this morning and get the ruler out and boom 9.5% over a 2 days period. There's nothing to worry about, I promise you this, when you begin to put fundamentals above the short term share price, you'll love seeing a 10% dip!!! Just DCA into the market, and if you just bought a fat lump sum of Bitcoin and now you're getting paranoid, just lower your average cost by buying at these lower prices. 

Finally, if you ask yourself ""if Bitcoin drops 60% in 4 hours, will I hold? Will I buy more? Or will I sell?"" If your answer is yes to the latter then you should seriously invest more TIME into EDUCATING yourself because investing in yourself could save yourself from being one of many many uneducated investors who buys high and sells low and never re-enters the market because of it. 60% dips are a blessing, there's nothing I think about more than ""I should have bought more at $35k"".

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is an investment tool that tracks an index or asset and can be purchased directly on the stock exchange. There are basically two types of Bitcoin ETFs. One is the spot-based Bitcoin ETF, which aims to track the price of Bitcoin. ETF funds will be custodial funds. For those investors seeking exposure to the Bitcoin market, it will save the trouble of self-custodial and preservation of Bitcoin spot; the other is Bitcoin futures ETF, which is based on other available Bitcoin ETFs for Bitcoin investment vehicles (Bitcoin futures), and these ETFs do not directly hold Bitcoin spot. By looking at the difference between the two, it is clear that futures-based ETFs will be more expensive and less efficient than spot-based ETFs. Futures ETFs require more maintenance due to their complex structure.

As early as 2013, Winklevoss tried to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF but was rejected by the SEC. Since then, many companies have tried, but all failed without exception. Now VanEck has also been rejected by the SEC after applying for a Bitcoin spot ETF for 8 months.

The SEC refused because they believed that the Bitcoin market had the following manipulations:

* 'Washing' transactions (buy with the left hand and sell with the right hand, artificially creating fluctuations in the market).
* People with influence in the Bitcoin spot market may manipulate Bitcoin pricing.
* Hackers attack the Bitcoin network (51% attack) and trading platform.
* Malicious control of the Bitcoin network.
* Transactions based on material non-public information, including the dissemination of false and misleading information.
* Manipulation involving the so-called 'stable currency' Tether (USDT).
* Fraud and manipulation of Bitcoin trading platforms.

Some people are disappointed by this, but most investment experts are not surprised that the SEC rejected the Bitcoin spot ETF application. The reason is that the Bitcoin market does not look like a regulated securities market. What the SEC is most satisfied with is that it looks like a traditional market. However, they are also optimistic about the future Bitcoin spot market and have predicted that by the end of 2022 to 2023, the Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved.

Although the United States continues to reject applications for Bitcoin spot ETFs, Canada has taken the lead in the market because it has approved some spot ETFs based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. US institutional investors such as ARK Invest have begun to contact spot ETFs located in Canada. In terms of financial innovation and supervision, Canada seems to be more active than the SEC. In addition, the mining market of the Canadian team is also developing rapidly. If Canada continues to accelerate the regulation of Bitcoin financial innovation, is it possible for Canada to overtake the United States to become the Bitcoin hegemon in the next two years?

I was thinking about the thousands of people who have profited immensely through bitcoin. I’m talking millions of dollars in capital gains with a high tax liability. Many of these investors, companies, individuals, etc will need to have some type of charitable contributions to offset some of those taxes. Perhaps nonprofits and charities should benefits from those in need of alleviating some of that tax liability. I’m no fool and I know the loopholes exist to avoid taxation but for those who don’t use these tax haves or strategies, I think charities could be a great way to make a difference benefiting both the donor and the nonprofit organization.

I am hoping someone could please explain to me why the 5.3 coins in my Bitcoin wallet are appearing when they have already been spent in 2013.  This 2013 wallet.dat originally had 1 BTC in it but somehow it was written over by 5.3 wallet.dat file - my original password for the 1BTC wallet.dat opened it.  These 5.3 were sent in 2013 and I have tracked it on the blockchain.  I have tried sending them but the Status:  0/unconfirmed, not in memory pool appears.  I have set higher fees to see if they would go through and left it open for 48 hours.  I have tried sending part and the full amount.  I have rescanned and rebroadcast - I have then abandoned the transaction and the coins return to the wallet.

You will see volition unlike the boomer market. 
You will develop balls of steel.
Those who hold will not lose money.

There is only 21 million Bitcoin.
When you panic sell the bear whales buy.


Do not spend more than you can afford to lose.
Do not buy with leveraged margin unless you can handle the margin call when the exchange comes knocking. 

For those institutions who panic sell and 'old money' new investors you're going to lose alot of money unless you learn the game.

I am 31 years old, and not very stupid, even though it might seem so when you finish this post.

I wish this **doesn't happen** to anyone else, and for that reason I write this here.

I will make it as short as possible. Excluding personal information

I was searching for opportunities to **invest Bitcoin**.

Found a company registered in the UK, number **08307335. Valuetrade LTD. In the past AAYAAN LTD. owned by Ali and Natasha Usman since 2012, seemed completely legitimate.**

**\*\*\*They target people that invest in Bitcoin, through Telegram\*\*\***

**Diving in:**

**First**, these are the facts:

They offer investment plans with earnings, in bitcoin, on a web-based system. Every investment plan has a price range, marked by fixed dollar margins:

**Plans:** **(1)** 0 - 499 **(2)** 500 - 2,999 **(3)** 3,000 - 14999 **(VIP)** 15,000+

**Earning &amp; Timelapse: (1)** 10% in 1day **(2)** 30% in 2d **(3)** 50% in 7d **(VIP)** 100% in 21d

**Rules:** There are no deposit limits, no withdrawal fees, no delays.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:** Sign On in the website [www.valuetrade.ltd](http://www.valuetrade.ltd/) , choose a deposit amount and plan, and make a transfer of chosen amount to a fixed wallet 

Their wallet for me is **1HEyxoXoA3Wqwex6WmZhdm2YcoFq1uhg2q** 

The site uses a system that marks the bitcoin decimals in any transaction by a fixed dollar price, but transactions are tied to bitcoin decimals. This makes it so when transferring to a certain plan, whatever arrives is what counts, not your intention.

Service is done through a telegram group. I followed the group for a while before investing. 1,800 members with usually 100 online, and a constant hype of successful deposits and withdrawals. The client service is done on private messages in Telegram too.

**Second**, this is what happened:

(Decimals are Bitcoin. Timestamps are -3 GMT)

**Deposits**:

**(1) Oct-29-2021 06:24:08 AM - Deposit - .00833 btc (504$)**

**(1) Oct-31-2021 01:26:00 PM - Deposit Return and withdrawal - .01089 (668$)**

**(2) Oct-31-2021 01:36:00 PM - Deposit - .01454 btc (880$)**

I requested withdrawal as shown above, and received the full sum with this information:

**Wallet** bc1q58z7gwl3g2mfx83j0gc5w0e7l9lr0ux2lzggh5kyjuf05cfe27fsgyzlwx

**Hash** 4fbf7e56c65ea713a4c49dab29f41e179106c9fed8c57e0dbb20d0dee47f759e

The second deposit was frozen because I wasn't eligible to invest in the level 2 plan again, only once is allowed **(NEW RULE).** I was then offered the option to invest a larger sum that will be added to the frozen sum **(2)**, and reflected in the website. So I deposited:

**(2) Nov-12-2021 01:16:21 PM - Deposit - .048585 btc (3,125$)**

A total of **3,990$** did reflect on the website, in the level 3 plan, 7 day time lapse.

This brought trust, and I deposited a sum to be reflected in the level 2 plan:

**(3) Nov-13-2021 2:46:39 AM - Deposit - .047 btc (at moment of transfer it was 2,990$)**

This sum was frozen too because it arrived over the price margin. (3,003$)

A solution was offered, another deposit will solve the issue:

**(4)** **Nov-13-2021 2:47:51 AM - Deposit - .03761 btc (2,395$)**

2 days elapsed, and this last deposit made its profit:**(4) Nov-15-2021 01:29:04 AM - Deposit Return and Withdrawal - .04746 (3,122$).**

**Wallet** 3PWnRCpmRV6ijCnWKo9xrgV9HeUkywBTpb

**Hash** 82aceb16c9d94fb7b479e07ddbcbe3afc7b109703189c87be6f7f01ea3b53f3c

I deposited once more with what I withdrew as follows:

**(5) Nov-15-2021 03:36:36 AM - Deposit - .04486 (2,952$)**

Total **Deposit** so far: ±9,945$

Total **Profit** so far: ±890$

**And here it starts for real:**

On the 16th, I get an e-mail saying I am eligible for a bonus reward. A sum 97,650$

But, there is a massive **Rule change**. I am told by the admin that I cannot withdraw my past investments until I complete the requirements.

Requirements\*\*:\*\*

Buy VIP membership and invest in a plan. (1) a non-refundable **payment** of 1,500$, and (2) an **investment** of above 15,000$. This will reinstate my withdrawal capabilities.

I paid for the VIP membership, through a direct wallet to wallet transfer, **without the web interface:**

**(6) Nov-18 1:59 AM- Payment - .0251 (1,500$)**

**Wallet:** 17XLrLmeUon47b4RtP3YiweaXH18rWsNBW

**Hash:** 5636ee939815569f507bc3b79376f1b443525420d08d3c58a1a3e2ee5bf4413c

6 hours later I took care of the second step, I sent **15,050$**, which delayed 4 hours in arriving and reflected as **14,840$** on their system after a big bitcoin price dip.

**(7) Nov-18 8:04 AM- Deposit - .25128 (14,840$)**

**Wallet:** 1HEyxoXoA3Wqwex6WmZhdm2YcoFq1uhg2q

**Hash:** 4991d314815ae7e827a20d5251a83f206cfd9a445dd2b6e4a5f97836f671ef73

I am told by the admin that he is **unable to manipulate the system.**

the solution is to **deposit again**. Until then, this amount and **all else** is frozen.

At this point I ran out of bitcoin, and so, asking for help in the same telegram group Valuetrade has, a member that doesn't know me offers to complete the amount I am missing, since he trusts the company. This person from Telegram sends the missing amount:

**(Loan) Nov-21 04:22 PM - Receive - .07549 (4,450$)**

**Wallet:** 3McUqozvq4Fo4G6hLPi9JfoWjEHdiVURCM

**Hash:** 2c80aa5bb58c99f47ddfecf2936d33518b149fe4e5da95965b3743959f0e7129

As this completed the requirement, I immediately make my last deposit on this ride:

**(8)** **Nov-21-2021 6:18:00 PM - Deposit - .26431 (15,700$)**

According to agreement, all is now available for withdrawal.

By the time the admin responds hours later, he insists I have delayed too long and for that reason, the **rules change again**. Now there is a **FEE of 10%** on withdrawals, paid up front.

This is where I realised **FINALLY** that it is a scam. This is my current position. I am just delaying right now.

The person who loaned me money is probably a part of it, or the same person.

**Total invested so far:** 0.67 bitcoin worth about **±39,250$,** not all of which was mine to start with.

(Not including 1,500$ VIP payment, and the loan of .07549).

**Supposed account balance to withdraw:** 111,979.10$

No negotiation has proved fruitful. He insists he has no power to manipulate the system and only a 0.1 deposit will allow me to withdraw 1 bitcoin. **A new 5,000$ deposit for 50,000$ withdrawal**. This deposit is done in the same way the VIP payment was made, sort of off the books, wallet to wallet.

I ask for information, proof, time, my investment back, anything. To no avail.

All I get is threats to act fast and deposit, or else rules change again.

I do not know why I didn't stop before, apparently there is something for me to learn here.

A wise man once told me, ""Bitcoin came to teach something, to all of us""

I am lucky to have the family I have.

**Done**

Questions to this awesome community:

1. Does anyone think this is legit? Am I wrongly accusing?
2. Do you think it is possible for me to recover my losses?
3. Do you think it advisable to take legal actions against this company?
4. Does anyone know someone that might help me and my family with this situation?

I filed a report on [ic3.gov](https://ic3.gov/).

I added all information and proof I could gather from the website and telegram, added what I could to this post. I have further information available.

I can't believe they scam like this and leave so much information available.

Please help warn people.

Help me get my family's savings back

I work at a university in the UK and one of my students approached me having found a set of files on the shared PC they were using tagged 'SN'. The student didn't think much of it, but as I delved through the files myself, It became apparent to me that they may be genuine.

Now, before I get into it, I know virtually nothing about Cryptocurrency etc. - but I do know enough to conclude that the info within these files could be immensely valuable. Therefore, I've set myself up using the pseudonym 'Michael Ward' on reddit and Twitter as I'm not interested in any sort of acclaim, I simply want to keep my job and provide for my family.

The files themselves, of which there are 11, are simple and easily accessible Word Documents that appear to have been written for posterity (in fact, the fist document actually uses that word). I have extensively searched online and these documents aren't available anywhere else that I can find. This of course raises a question - are they a hoax? My initial thoughts were that clearly it was a joke, maybe a student was bored one day. However, as a read more about Satoshi online, certain aspects of the information seemed to click into place. For one, the metadata (the created dates) - having looked back, between 2009-2012ish Bitcoin was a virtually unknown entity. Why/how would a student (or perhaps even one of my colleagues) at that time even know about Satoshi - let alone be able to write up 11 pages worth of detail on him/her/them? I'm also unsure as to why someone would spend such a length of time formulating, in great detail, a set of 11 documents only for them to get lost in the annals of time. Surely the creator, if it was a hoax, would have wanted these to be found sooner? Who knows, I'm not a psychologist. Having now read through numerous pieces of correspondence I am also struck with the similarity in writing style between the author and Satoshi. 

My question is - what should I do with these files?

Anyway, for now I've moved the PC into my office and, for purposes of the image attached, I've angled the tower as it shows university details.

Newer Blockchain though has transection per second but they've low VTPS i.e $1000-2000 per second with less number of nodes (highly centralised) hence low security, therefore new Blockchain mislead people by comparing TPS.

So BTC which has 7-10 TPS is more valuable then incoming New Blockchain with High TPS i e Solana and Avax.

I have had a jerking off addiction for a larger part of my life and it is not something I am proud of. I’ve tried everything I can to stop from deleting all triggering apps , using internet filters , keeping myself occupied, giving myself consequences everytime I fail and so much more but it all seems to fail. 

I came to a realization after achieving post nut clarity that it is most likely an addiction I won’t be able to overcome so the best I can do is manage/make the most of it at least. 

I practice a budgeting system using a money pipeline modeled after [Thomas Frank’s money pipeline](https://collegeinfogeek.com/budgeting-for-college-students/) and I decided anytime I beat my meat I will take a 100$ from my entertainment fund and put it into my Bitcoin savings this way even though I fail in managing my addiction I get punished ( paying for beating my meat ) and rewarded ( investing into a long term fund ) at the same time.

I would hear a lot in crypto communities that everyone gets liquidated in futures at one point, I just never though it'd happen to me.

I only started trading futures a month and a half ago. I basically lost $6.5k that I put in, which is pretty much all the savings I had and the profits that I made along with it. All because I didn't use stop losses and the positions just kept falling. I also should have never opened more than 10 positions. I had about 14.

I was doing pretty well too upto this point. Since I am apart of some signals chats I had made decent money trading 20x lev, about $200-$400 per day in profit. I would also exit losing positions quick - but this flash crash caught me off guard. All my positions were losing positions and I didn't want to realize losses.

I wanted to share this here, maybe some of you could give me advice about anything at this point, don't know who to talk to about it. I know I can succeed with futures but I don't even know where I go from here since I'm unemployed too. Its really taking a toll on my mental.

I am currently using Coinbase as the only Exchange. When I am selling Bitcoin there is a fee, which I have to pay. So I thought to just convert the amount of BTC I want to take as a profit into USDC or USDT, as they are Stablecoins and the conversion fee is close to zero. I would just hold that amount of stablecoins until the next dip, where I would reinvest my earlier profits by converting the USDC/USDT back into BTC. Would that work out or am I overseeing something?

Before  it became popular among the masses, bitcoin was exclusively used for  money laundring and as a black market currency. It's still used for  money laundring and black markets to this day of course, and it's great  at that , but for some reason people actually think that it's some kind  of investment as well.

&amp;#x200B;

However,  Bitcoin is not an investment at all. It's nothing but a pyramid  sheme.Think about it, when you buy a stock, you buy a share of a company  that generates value for others.If the generated value grows, your  stock becomes more expensive.That's an investment, a company took your  money and made more money with it.

But  if you buy a bitcoin, there's no value behind it. You just hope that  more people will buy bitcoin as well.Since the supply is pretty stable,  the only way for the price to go up is to increase demand.So if you  ""invest"" in Bitcoin, your just hoping that others do so as well.It can't  grow forever of course, at some point, every person that can buy  bitcoin, has so. If that point is reached, the price of bitcoin can only  go down, since no one wants to lose all of their money.

&amp;#x200B;

But  maybe you don't want to invest, maybe you want to build  the future for  an anonymes, decantrilsed currency. That sounds pretty good.

But  there's a problem. As i mentioned, the supply of bitcoins is pretty  stable, it's only increasing slightly. That is a problem for any modern  economy, since they're all based on slight inflation.Inflation is when  you can buy less stuff with your money, than before. It's the reason why  your grandparents ice cream only costed 10 cents or so.However,  inflation is very important. If you know that your money will lose  value, you'll want to spend it as soon as possible.This is important to  give an incentive to spend and invest, which is the way the economy  grows(Saving a lot is actually bad for the economy. Your money just  sits, without generating new value for others).

Since  Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, it would probably crash the economy  if it was implemented as a global currency. People would save, not  spend, companies wouldn't make more profits, people would get fired,  which increases poverty. Similiarly wo what happend during the great  depression.A slight amount of inflation is needed for an economy.Not to  mention the importance of state debt. States (and everyone else)  couldn't lend money anymore, which would kill the already dead economy  as well. btw [state debt isn't inherantly bad](https://youtu.be/VslKKgYvVKU),  without it, poor countries couldn't develop and would be stuck in  povery for ever basically and rich countries couldn't grow as quikly.

&amp;#x200B;

Electricity consumption is bad as well. We could do so much better thing with it.  


Now  please don't think i'm a neoliberal millionaire or something, i'm not  saying that we should be spending our money and never save, i'm just  saying that consuming is the way the economy is run.Buying books, food,  clothing, furniture, is to consume.It's important to have regulations  and stuff.

\- The continued praise of Satoshi and his vision, I believe bitcoin has mostly stayed true to its core values

The idea that government spending/debt in no way contributes to inflation ignores the World's experience with debt for the last 100 years. These assertions are ridiculous. I quote:

""All of this refutes the notion that the government spending and tax breaks to support the economy through the pandemic, including the [American Rescue Plan](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/economic-assessment-of-biden-fiscal-rescue-package.pdf) this past March, are somehow behind the higher inflation. These factors certainly gave a boost to demand last spring, but that faded when the Delta variant gained momentum this fall. There is also no good way to connect the dots between the [Build Back Better agenda](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/press-releases?ID=A3810584-1BD2-4667-B686-4E939FBAFBF6), which is currently being debated in Congress, and higher inflation.""

Inflation comes out a series of bad choices most often, not a singular event. And the fact that it didn't happen at the exact moment does not prove your thesis one bit. Consider the worlds experience with war time spending and the aftermath. This piece was written with an agenda and it sucks.

What is $LiteCoin 

$LiteCoin  is a project we started with the intention to grant a safe and nice ride to the stars. We got sick of rug-pulls and scams in this ocean rugs, we offer you a seat on one of the hottest rockets in the game. Our main goal is to create an NFT marketplace for coins just like this one. The project is a way of giving the community, something they can put money in  later on and get something back from it like a special NFT award

 

Safety :

As stated in the contract code. Ownership was renounced before launch and liquidity is locked for 1 Year.

 Personally, I jump into anything with a website and LP locked if I'm early enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Passive Rewards (RFI) :

The holders are automatically rewarded more $LCby holding. This is done by charging a 7% tax on all transactions, which are then split 4% to all holders as rewards, and 4% automatically added to the liquidity pool, creating price support and stability.

Most of the time, the usual bitcoiner response is ""never"". However, if you never sell, then how can you ever enjoy the profits? This is where things diverge. So far, I have never seen anyone mentioning an alternative to the following option:

Take a loan against your BTC and let ""inflation"" do the job. If BTC is $1 million and you take a loan of $100k against 0.1 of your BTC, when BTC gets to $10 million your loan will be just 0.01BTC+interest, tending to zero as BTC goes to infinity. Fine. But that assumes BTC do go to infinity, or appreciate forever. Probably it will. But will it in your life time, or when the loan is due? You don't know that.

A second option I see almost nobody talking about is:

**Write call options on your bitcoin.**

Yes. Find a strike price and a time frame for which you would be comfortable letting the upside go to the option holder, short the option, and let time do the job. I find relying on time much better because time, differently from price, only goes in one direction: forward, while price can go up or down. If the bitcoin price ends below the strike price (any price, even $0.01), you will earn the premium. If it ends above, then you will lose the part of the upside that is above the strike price only. Example (with **real trading prices as of right now**):

Imagine you own 1 bitcoin and you are ok with sacrificing all upside above a $300K price by Sep 30th, 2022. The price of a 300K call option due at this date on Deribit is 0.042 BTC (ask price). This means that if you short this option, you get paid 0.042 BTC after 326 days for any price BTC ends, as long as it is below 300K.

BTC is 50K in 326 days = you earn 0.042 BTC per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

BTC is 150K in 326 days = you earn 0.042 BTC per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

BTC is 250K in 326 days = you earn 0.042 BTC per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

Now, what if you want to lock-in the dollar value of the 0.042BTC instead? Because, for example, you are concerned that bitcoin may go down so if it goes to 10K, you want 0.042 BTC at the current price of 65K, not at 10K price. **Great, you can do that**! Short 0.042 BTC worth of futures expiring in September-2022, and you can lock-in, today, a dollar value of 0.042\*73000 = $3,066. Then

BTC is 50K in 326 days = you earn $3,066 per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

BTC is 150K in 326 days = you earn $3,066 per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

BTC is 250K in 326 days = you earn $3,066 per option sold. You still have all your BTC plus that.

Of course, all these ""gains"" come at a price: if the price explodes above 300K, then you are left with 300K per coin, plus the premium.

BTC is 350K in 326 days = you earn 0.042 BTC per option sold. But you have 300/350 = 0.857 BTC per each BTC you had.

BTC is 600K in 326 days = you earn 0.042 BTC per option sold. But you have 300/600 = 0.50 BTC per each BTC you had.

And so on. If you had shorted future contracts to lock-in the 0.042 BTC, just replace 0.042BTC by $3,066 in the computations above.

Is this a ""risky"" trade? Yes. But the risk you incur is a different type of risk than when you take a loan against your bitcoin. When you take a loan against your bitcoin, you have a type of risk called ""wrong way"" risk: the more BTC goes down, the more poor you are (because the value of your bitcoin holdings go down) and the more likely you are to default on your loan (because your collateral is less valuable and you will have to sell more bitcoin to pay it). The advantage of taking this risk is that you have no upside limitations. BTC can go to a gazillion dollars and you would have a ridiculously small debt to pay, which you can do by selling a very tiny amount of bitcoin. However, I believe that most of those holding bitcoins want to preserve their wealth once acquired, and avoid taking unnecessary risks once bitcoin get to a certain dollar amount. In that case, it might be more appropriate to take this other kind of risk, where the situation where you ""lose"" is actually the situation where bitcoin goes up too much too fast, and you lose some of the upside. Sure, you probably will be sad that you could have more by doing nothing, if this happens, but even if this happens, you still enjoyed a nice capital gain and earned a premium.",3527819,How to live off your bitcoin without ever selling them and without having to take loans against them,0,1.0,2021-11-08 20:23:30,POSITIVE,0.9992741942405701

I would like to open discussion to not only what additional capabilities this brings to the first layer of bitcoin, but also what the benefits and limitations will exist on sidechain systems like thorchain, Sovryn and Portal that currently exists on ethereum, as well as LN layer 2 capabilities.

From [https://kraken.docsend.com/view/9e9y7may8526z934](krakens published Taproot explainer) -

&gt;Bip-tapscript introduces ﬂexibility to enhance bitcoin's smart contract capability and changes some limits for resource requirements, including the removal of the byte size limit that exists in legacy scripts. Tapscript provides a forward­compatibility mechanism, known as “tagged public keys,” that makes it easy for future soft forks to extend the signature-checking opcodes with new sighash types or other changes.

&gt;All in all, the soft fork's main feature will allow multisig transactions and complex smart contracts to be indistinguishable from standard transactions via key aggregation. As a result, even the most complex smart contracts will be virtually identical to regular transactions on the blockchain. Thus, taproot's signature aggregation technique can improve the privacy of the lightning letwork (LN), an application built upon bitcoin to improve scalability, by making transactions that represent the opening and closing of LN channels impossible to identify when observing the blockchain. 

Tapscript + MAST + new opcodes + size limit removal appears to open the doors for full DeFi applications to be ran on sidechain/layer2 networks, but what will be the short-term and long-term implications?

What barriers will exist in short term that prevent the complexity of ethereum-like smart contracting (liquidity providing, cross chain swapping, lending, etc) to be executed on either layer 1 or 2 on BTC?",3527315,Limitations on smart contract capabilitiesbilities post Taproot upgrade?,0,1.0,2021-11-08 17:58:38,NEGATIVE,0.9977734684944153

1. When considering the current supply of Bitcoin, whales own approximately 14% of the market
2. When considering the millions of lost coins / inactive wallets - some estimate up to 33% of total supply - the market share of Bitcoin Whales is much higher
3. This concentration of market share in the hands of a few (there are approximately 86 whales out there, with at least 10k bitcoins each) enables those at the top of the bitcoin food chain to have significant market impact without disclosure, notification, etc. to other market participants 
4. There is no concept of ""insiders"" in bitcoin/crypto markets as there are in securities markets in the U.S., for example. This designation triggers certain disclosure requirements for those who own a 10% stake or more in a company. 

This [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/law-politicking-worldwide/id1589987944?i=1000541111371) covers the topics above in more detail, but the question remains - is bitcoin whale risk significant enough to disrupt market integrity in the future?

First of all, since my last post there haven't been any protest about btc.

There haven't been any major issue or breaking new about btc in general...as I said many times before, nothing has really changed, just another payment method.

However there have been many issues in the chivo app, the official wallet.

Transactions between chivo apps works fine, if you're sending btc, by default you use a L1 qr code, however tx are instant with no issues so you can assume tx are not really done through the btc network.

Transactions (either L1 or LN) from an external wallet like muun or coinomi  to chivo app works fine.

Transactions (either L1 or LN) from chivo app to an external wallet have many problems, sometimes work, sometimes not...simply like that, although  I personally found that $2 transactions trough LN have no issues, problems appear from $5 onwards.

Also, failed transactions are still deducted from your balance, so you have to call chivo app customer support and make a report of the tx, you have to wait about a week four your money to be reimbursed. 

Remember my $2 tx? which was originally $20 but due to a bug only $2 were send) I tough it was on the way to my other wallet however customer service told that failed chivo tx don't even enter the btc network...still I got my money back.

I've done other tx to external wallets and lost (temporaly) my money, have to call many times to customer support and wait (about a week) for a reimbursement.

Similar problems have occurred sending money from chivo to a bank account.

The next big issue is quite funny and frightening at the same time, many people start getting extra money, hundreds, thousands and millions of dollars...here is an article with a pic[million](https://m.elsalvador.com/noticias/negocios/chivo-wallet-empresa-bukele-dinero-fraude/891236/2021/)

This happened a couple weeks ago and is now fixed, but social media was stamped with people's chivo wallet screenshots.

There were some people that send that money to their bank accounts and others retrieve it in chivo atms, later on they were called and ordered to give the money back, if not, prison and other legal things will be the outcome.

Lastly, in chivo app you can convert btc to USD and viceversa while having a one minute period to make tx at a certain price, many people start scalping and making a nice profit. This was quickly fixed and now you have to wait 3 minutes between tx.

So this were the most important things to notice, the gas discount still continues and its now $0.30 less for gallon, a vet will be built using the btc profit (although they won't sell the btc and get the earnings through other means).

Aside chivo app problems everything is fine, some people   start getting interest in crypto and some other doesn't care.

Well, this is not the case.
Today I want to bring you a famous example, the blockchain elections.

Blockchain elections, as these ""experts"" explain, could create the real democracy.
No more central entities checking and counting the votes, transparency and security at the highest level, the final solution for a democracy without any type of vulnerabily.

This is all wrong, let me explain why.

Democracy is ""a system of government by the whole population"".
Democracy is based on giving to every individual the same weight, when it's time to vote.

Decentralized blockchains can't check the identity of a voter, so decentralied blockchains CAN'T SUPPORT BLOCKCHAIN ELECTIONS.

In order to be sure that every voter is a real human and in order to check whether a person voted only once, a central entity is needed!
The alternative is having public blockchain elections, where everyone can see the identity and the decision made by the every voter.

A public blockchain election is more vulnerable than our current voting system, because every measure against the sale of votes and against extortion will be vanished.

Blockchain elections, are only possible with centralized entities checking the identity of the voters, which means these will be centralized blockchain elections.",3522579,"Decentralized blockchain elections are not possible, and none seems to understand it",0,1.0,2021-11-07 16:38:08,NEGATIVE,0.9998632669448853

So on its way, Vuuzle Media Corp Limited is launching a new cryptocurrency trading platform called [**CryptoCapTrades**](https://buyvuco.com/). The platform will allow you to store, send, buy and sell existing cryptocurrencies. 

In July 2021, Vuuzle Media Corp Limited released its first crypto token, VUCO COIN. And a month later, in August 2021, the company creates and launches a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, which allows the public to buy and sell cryptocurrency at a lower exchange rate using a new platform. In addition, cryptocurrency trading is an exclusive platform on which crypto investors can buy a newly minted Vuco coin or trade it on the stock exchange. Vuco is paired with Ethereum under the erc20 blockchain.

In November 2021, Vuuzle Media Corp Limited launches its new website [www.buyvuco.com](https://buyvuco.com/) , which provides round-the-clock access for online users around the world to watch movies and TV shows that are broadcast live at  [www.vuuzlestudiosdubai.com](http://www.vuuzlestudiosdubai.com/) .

The company plans to place Vuco Coin on Uniswap and add current non-market sales and liquidity to the Vuco coin.   
**Crypto Cap Trades** is the only decentralized exchange platform that offers reliable global deployment. 11 11 witness nodes are distributed in 11 cities in 8 countries around the world, providing lightning-fast network speed and providing stable and reliable trading services for hundreds of thousands of cryptocurrency traders around the world.

Vuuzle Media Corp Limited announces that it is choosing STO (Security Token Offerings) as a form of investing in blockchain projects. 

Tokenized securities are shares of companies. The main difference between them and utility and payment tokens is that holders of tokenized securities have ownership rights, and utility and payment tokens act as coupons and do not give their owners the rights of traditional investors.

In fact, share tokens are a category of security tokens that represent ownership of such an asset, such as debt or equity. The Howey test, adopted by the SEC, is used to determine whether a digital token is a tokenized security. It is used to test whether an agreement can be classified as an “investment contract”.

**According to Vuuzle Media Corp Limited founder** [**Ronnie Flynn**](https://ronnieflynnofficial.com/) **, STOs are launched with regulatory management in mind. They are registered in the necessary state bodies, meet all the requirements of the law and are 100% LEGAL.**

**For a token to be classified as an investment contract, it must meet the following requirements:**

* the user invests money;
* the user expects to receive a return on investment;
* investments are in “joint ownership”;
* the owner receives profit from the actions of outsiders (not organizers) or promoters.

According to a document published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all ICOs are required to go through the registration process. Security tokens and the supply of security tokens are expected to be the next trend in cryptography. Security tokens are subject to federal securities regulations and take effect on the first day of the WTO.

Based on the rules that the SEC plans to introduce for blockchain companies that develop tokenized securities, investors must meet at least one of the following requirements:

An annual income of more than $ 200,000 per person or $ 300,000 for a married couple that has been maintained for the past two years and is projected for the year in which the person plans to invest;

Net assets of more than $ 1 million, which do not include the value of real estate in which the investor resides on a permanent basis;

An organization with assets of more than $ 5 million, including venture and trust funds;

An organization whose members are all accredited investors.

* Significantly lower commissions compared to traditional investments;
* Fast transaction processing due to the lack of a long chain of intermediaries;
* Expanding the investor base;
* Automated transactions and others.
* **VUUZLE MEDIA CORP LIMITED WE WILL USE UNISWAP!** It is worth noting that the popularity of Uniswap today is incredible. In fact, it is a decentralized exchange based on Ethereum (DEX), which facilitates the exchange of ERC-20 tokens between traders. Compared to any other DEX exchanges, Uniswap is much easier to use. Thanks to peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, any transactions can be conducted without intermediaries.

Importantly, as of October 2020, Uniswap was considered the largest decentralized exchange and the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange in general in terms of daily trading volume, according to  [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-16/defi-boom-makes-uniswap-most-sought-after-crypto-exchange) .

The Uniswap protocol was inspired by Vitalik Buterin’s concept of “automated market maker” (AMM). Uniswap mainly uses the Constant Product Market Maker Model, an Automated Market Making (AMM) mechanism that contains liquidity pools for traders. Uniswap does not use a bid book to determine prices. Instead, the protocol works on the basis of an equation where total liquidity is a constant in the pool. In order for the model to work, it takes into account sources of liquidity. So it creates a pool that supports decentralized trade and lending. The process involves listing and swapping ERC-20 tokens without an order book.",3592511,VUCO COIN!!!,0,1.0,2021-11-23 12:39:03,POSITIVE,0.7955822944641113

More than 600%, as I was taught at school, if interest is 20% that means you can expect $200,000 every year and after ten years you will get 3 million dollars, but there are $6,191,000.74. How? Furthermore interesting.

It is really shocked me. You know, it turns out the compound interest is what happens when you reinvest your earnings, which then earn interest as well. Compound interest essentially means ""interest on the interest"" and is the reason many investors are so successful.

Think of it this way. Let's say you invest $10,000 at 20% interest. After the first year, you receive a $2,000 interest payment.

But, instead of putting it in your pocket, you reinvest it at the same 20% rate. For the second year, your interest is calculated on a $14,400 investment, which comes to $4400.

If you reinvest that, your third-year interest will be calculated on a $17,280 balance. After ten years your $10,000 accumulates to $60,191.74.

After 20 years you will have $383,376 in your balance. I'd like to say just “Oh my god”.

Compound interest is such a powerful tool that Albert Einstein once called it the most important invention in all of human history.

So that's why banks don’t provide loans in compound interest because it doesn’t benefit them.",3592506,Why compound interest is such a powerful tool?,0,1.0,2021-11-23 12:37:52,POSITIVE,0.640209436416626

Am I missing something somewhere that can point to the value of a BTC without throwing a USD, CAD, Quid, or other currency in front of it?

And when my family finds out about the money I hold, they might expect me to maybe even do something small like go out for dinner. But the thing is, I don't even buy food for myself.

After learning what a hash was - I asked, why can't the algorithm simply be reversed? Why can't Miners could just reverse engineer a winning hash and win every block. 

Let me try and explain:

Say I create an algorithm that applies a multiplier of (2) to every input. Everyone can see my algorithm. If I produced a hash of (6), would you know what my original number was? You could calculate that my input was (3). Simply reverse my algorithm, by dividing the hash output by (2).

Now let's say, another function of my algorithm is it deletes every digit except the last one. 

If I end up with a hash of (6), would you know what my original number was? Yes, you could just divide 6 by my known multiplier of (2), you would know the input was (3). 

Wait, no sir, my input was actually (8)!!!

8 x 2 = 16, and because every digit is deleted except the last one, the (1) would be deleted, and we would again end up with (6). 

If my input was (13), or (18), AGAIN YOU WOULD GET AN OUTPUT OF (6). 

This is why hashes can't easily be reversed: the algorithm forces some data to be lost (in my case deleting every digit except the last one). 

The input will ALWAYS create the same output, but calculating backward results in near infinite options.

# I put all my life savings into bitcoins

Last week, I put all my life savings into Bitcoin. I'm only 30 so I know while it is a risk, I still have a chance to recover if it crashes, and I have a full time job anyway. I just thought how the people around me are putting money into their houses, into children and expensive weddings, and they will never get a return on that. It just disappears. I also thought how most people will go their whole life and not take a risk and 'go for it'... and when I'm older, I will not be able to things like this. I will be a lot more conservative. Now is the time for me to take a risk.

So I put a total of about $50,000 USD and bought in. I don't know how long I'll keep it in, but I'm thinking at least 5 to 10 years, maybe longer. I haven't told anyone and I don't plan to, but I feel good about it. Another thing I think about is that there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever released, and that is NOTHING when I stop and think about it. To me it seems like a great opportunity.",3526567,This Dude Put His Life Savings into Bitcoin 8 Years Ago--He's Got to Be Feeling Good Now!,0,1.0,2021-11-08 14:53:41,POSITIVE,0.9996371269226074

Bitcoin soared on Monday, ending nearly three weeks of horizontal fluctuations, with continuous demand of approximately $60,000.

According to CoinDesk data, the cryptocurrency broke through US$66,000 during European time, and it seems that it will challenge the record high of US$66,975 set on October 20. The native token of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether, also broke the previous record early on Monday; according to CoinDesk data, its price briefly exceeded $4,700 at around 1:00 UTC. In terms of market capitalization, Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world, while Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency.

Yuya Hasegawa, a cryptocurrency market analyst at the Japanese exchange bitbank, said that actual or inflation-adjusted bond yield declines may push Bitcoin higher. Hasegawa told CoinDesk in an email statement: “The decline in actual yields due to inflation concerns may have led to the recent BTC rebound.” Data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed that the 10-year actual yield fell to -1.09% on Friday. This is the lowest since August 30.

Bitcoin is widely regarded as a hedge asset like gold. Although Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated last week that price pressures may be temporary, concerns about out-of-control inflation still exist.

Coinbase stated in its weekly email on Friday: ""The narrative of inflation still dominates the headlines, and people are feeling the pressure worldwide."" ""Whether it is natural gas prices in the United States, energy prices in Europe or food prices in Latin America. , The unfavorable factors of supply chain constraints and the shrinking labor force, investors are looking for a means of storing value.""

Eddie Wang, senior analyst at OKLink Research, the on-chain data research department of cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, said that on-chain data also showed signs of bullishness for Bitcoin in the medium term. Wang said that since July, the network's computing power has been steadily increasing, and the difficulty of mining has increased by 8 times. Since September, miners have accumulated more than 3,000 BTC in their wallets.

Wang said that the number of unique wallets with a balance of more than zero has recovered to 39 million, close to the record high of 39.28 million non-zero wallets in May, and cited this data as an indicator of positive market sentiment.

Wang said that the increase in bitcoin-linked coins and stablecoins is also a sign of a bull market. The analyst pointed out that 6,022 packaged bitcoins (WBTC) were printed on Ethereum in the past 7 days, and Tether printed 1 billion ERC-20 USDT on November 5.

Data tracked by blockchain analysis company Chainalysis shows that large investors (ie, whales) have regained their holdings. Investors holding at least 1,000 BTC snapped up 142,000 tokens in the last week of October, bringing the cumulative total to nearly 200,000 BTC-the highest level in 2021.

Daniel Kukan, a senior cryptocurrency trader at Crypto Finance AG, based in Switzerland, said that Bitcoin's latest upward trend seems to be driven by the spot, because the interest rate or cost of holding long positions in the perpetual futures market is still low.

&amp;#x200B;

According to data provided by [Coinglass.com](https://Coinglass.com), the average funding rate early on Monday was 0.0250%, compared with 0.0589% on November 3rd. The exchange calculates the financing rate every eight hours. Very high funding rates are widely considered to represent excessive bullish leverage. Rising costs and sideways prices often force traders to cut long positions, leading to price corrections.

Kukan said the sideways trading in the past few weeks is a typical bull market pause. ""This is a healthy integration. The market has not yet tested the short-term support of $58,000. This is a strong signal,"" Kukan added. ""I can see someone interested in selling for a little over $70,000, \[but, I think we will reach this level soon.""

The Japanese exchange bitbank expects the price of Bitcoin this week to be as low as $58,000 and as high as $76,000.

You would think that a Blockchain ETF constists of companies whos main focus is around crypto and or blockchain technology, but what you really get is some random companies who names were mentioned together with the word blockchain in a news article and some random tech stocks

I mean good job Invesco for putting RIO TINTO in there, which yes is a mining company, but sorry bitcoins aren\`t found in the ground of the australian desert.

Also companies like for example BANCO SANTANDER, ALCOA CORP, CERES INC, GMO INTERNET which are all in the ETF sure might be interesting companies but their business Model existed long before there was anything close to blockchain technology.  
I can somewhat understand that they put so many chip and hardware manifactures like INTEL, AMD, TUL CORPORATION, BIOSTAR MICROTECH, SAMSUNG etc. in there, because they sure benefit from the trend of this technology. But why specifically these? Why not for example NVIDIA, which sells their graphic cards like hotcakes thanks to crypto?

I feel like this whole ETF was created by some 60 years old boomer who didn\`t really knew what Blockchain even is so he just bruto force style searched for news articles that cotain words like blockchain, mining or bitcoin and than put in whatever he things the kids of today might find cool or he himself owns privatly

This blew my mind tonight. USD has only existed in El Salvador since 2001, but in 2008 the US bailed out the banks by literally DOUBLING the money supply. You could see the effect of that, on 28 Nov 2008 $1 USD was $1.58 AUD, by Sept 2011 it was down to $0.94 AUD. Then the US economy made a recovery and pumped the price of their shitcoin back up to $1.34 where it is today.

But El Salvador is no longer at the whims of US government monetary policy, what an epically ahead-of-the-curve little country!

Eventually, folks are going to have an in-depth understanding of why it's appropriate to call USD a shitcoin. Recently I found https://fiatmarketcap.com/ -&gt; This site is amazing, it lists fiat moneys in the same way that coinmarketcap lists cryptos. And it prices them all in BTC, and BTC is currently sitting at 14th highest market cap and 1.01% dominance.

You can bet that this 1.01% dominance will slowly get to 10% dominance then by that stage it will become fairly obvious to everybody that it is going to at least compete with MasterCard and visa (which puts it at like, 30% dominance), and by that stage most people will probably be convinced that owning bitcoin gives you a better return than owning cash, which should drive it to at least 50% dominance (50% of all people on earth prefer to own Bitcoin than their local currency).

So at this point you're still only at 50%, but damn Bitcoin is going to be looking good compared to fiat at that point. Nearly half of all the people you know are preferring Bitcoin to fiat, businesses are starting to accept it by default. And all your friends got extra purchasing power when you got none. So at that point it's all riding downhill, everybody is going to switch and overnight fiat will go out the door.

The following year it will be as if nothing happened.

And this shit is getting more and more obvious the more you just think about what has happened so far, and what is likely to happen in the future.

I seriously wish I had more money to invest!

And El Salvador is WAY ahead of the game. That little Central American country of just ~6.5 million people is going to get a lot of wealth disproportional to their output over the next 20 years. If 50% of people in El Salvador adopt Bitcoin earlier than 50% of the US, then 50% of the US that eventually adopts Bitcoin is essentially shifting a whole lot of their wealth to this tiny central American nation. They're going to see some epic success in the future. Not everybody is on board with Bitcoin in El Salvador at the moment, but when they realise that holding Bitcoin gives them extra purchasing power every year, compared with holding USD, of course the whole country is going to make the switch, and there is less friction than in other countries because businesses accept it.",3526407,Thought experiment about the future,0,1.0,2021-11-08 14:10:56,POSITIVE,0.9956718683242798

2) Popularity- this is my first year in the market. At age 30, with a well rounded knowledge of investing… how many countless others have yet to dabble and/or recognize the benefits of Bitcoin and it’s counterparts amongst the crypto world?

3)Adoption- there are only a handful of businesses, countries, and individuals taking an interest in the benefits of Bitcoin  to date. Imagine the cataclysmic jump when FOMO sets in for those big pockets late to the party!

4) Inflation- I firmly believe history tends to repeat itself. This may be pessimistic, but realistic in my opinion.. inflation has been creeping up for a decade now… how will folks react when we relive another “Great Depression”. Gold will not be the savior it used to be! Where will the safe haven be for those with significantly large incomes to lose??? Needless to say, I think it will be btc.

These are just a few reasons I have taken the leap into Bitcoin. If it has taken me this long to realize the benefits of Bitcoin, how many countless others like me around the globe have yet to take interest? My first purchase was at 60k months ago… it would be naive to think Bitcoin will not have further success. Yes, I bought the dip… BUT, I am just now positive from my first transaction… 

ITS STILL EARLY!!!

LFGO!!!

What most voters don't realize about high tax rates is that the rich (and wealthy) don't pay them. I don't. When a rate gets high enough, they simply arrange their financial affairs as circumstances demand, or they simply leave. Therefore, high tax rates are SYMBOLIC, not real, for both individuals and businesses. They're designed to win votes and affect progressive imagery. The Infrastructure Bill's crypto legislation, whereby they dismiss the risks you've taken, co-opt your gains, and steal from your children's future to fund programs that have nothing to do with rebuilding America let alone infrastructure, will have the opposite intended effect. It will energize crypto and greatly impair their ability to levy taxes. It will create an unstoppable nightmare, that you should be happy to lever against them in a vicious cycle. 

For a quick signpost to visualizing this, I'd like to proffer an example via the Second Amendment. I'm not a Democrat or Republican by the way, and despise both parties. I believe if you vote for the best of two evils, things only get more evil. Anyway, consider the decades of gun control and assault weapons bans in Illinois, a state which until *Moore v Madigan* (a Supreme Court case) was last in the United States to legalize concealed carry. The gun control was all imagery. Symbolism. The state's cities now have a new problem: cheap untraceable ghost guns. These fall into two categories: 3D printed guns, and 3/4th lower receivers. If you don't know how amazing 3D printed guns have gotten over the years, and where they're heading, watch this tip of the iceberg:

https://youtu.be/C4dBuPJ9p7A

3/4th lower receivers come with all the tooling needed to complete them.

Since 3D guns are open source CAD files that are distributed for free on the internet, and because many intricate 3D gun designers consider themselves artists, it's now become a 1st Amendment issue. My point is when you restrict freedom, it goes underground and strengthens from the threats above, sheds its unprotected vectors, emerging often as something far more impairment resistant. Those ghost guns are never leaving Chicago, and will proliferate everywhere eventually. It's a fantastic little business. Meanwhile, gun control advocates have another front (another Amendment) to fight, and have been backed into a corner where they have to actually propose ideas of value, and solutions, no symbolism. In the United States at large, if you'd like to know how disruptive 3D guns are, consider the strange bedfellows they've made of gun manufacturers (who view it as a financial threat) and Democrats....

It'll be far worse legislating crypto with tactics borrowed from the failed drug war. The Infrastructure Bill law, assuming there's no amendment to it in the next year, goes into effect January 2023. Here's what you can expect shortly before its implementation:

 - Hardware wallets will be on multi-month backorder

 - A certain privacy coin with atomic swap capability will rally as its service is levered

 - Crypto friendly countries will advertise their pitches and roll out red carpets; airlines routes will expand

 - A match will get taken to DeFi setting off a liquidity explosion as crypto seeks safety. It will reach critical mass and become a major threat to bank margins. More than 10% of the entire supply of BTC could get wrapped (this is temporary), it's already at 2% and atomic swap solutions are being tooled to avoid wrapping making things easier. But most importantly there will come an outbreak of synthetic assets (synths), which will be more disruptive than even I can contemplate, causing US stock markets, and all kinds of markets all kinds of problems

 - Then emerges decentralized insurance on a commercial scale (I'm already insured through NexusMutual) which will erode the advantages of CEX's further 

 - And finally the overlooked problem for governments which benefits the little guy and individuals most: LocalBitcoins.com, as it has another moment. For anyone that doesn't know, this is how you sell crypto for cash (and vice-versa) with locals around you. Tax-free, record-free, like we did in the old days. I've been using it for many years. There are plenty of solutions like this that will rise to meet demand while the USD still maintains its peg.

I won't get into how the Lightning Network can aid and abet, but know the aim of this post: you're a fool if you pay crypto taxes, and for newbs, after your brief honeymoon with CEX's like Coinbase, Binance, or RobinHood to learn the basics, you should have a hard wallet and feel your way around DeFi. 

Privacy solutions continue getting better, the friction of crypto wallets and DeFi continues falling, crypto education is proliferating, and decentralized insurance (a billionaire making opportunity) will emerge. The ability for governments to levy taxes will become impaired. This means more global money printing, and the militarization of tax collection agencies. It's a vicious loop though, and how soon governments will lose their ability to afford any enforcement. Eventually only real solutions, ideas of value, and transparent accounting will incentivize taxpayers enough to open a payment channel. The prestige of politicians fades.

TL;DR at bottom

Hi everybody,

I’m brand new to Bitcoin. Literally downloaded coinbase a few hours ago. I would love to learn more about it, as I genuinely believe in the power of this revolutionary project.


Anyways, a friend who frequents the forum told me I might be able to find a community of supportive people. I need just that. I’m going through a rough patch. I’m a graduate student at a state university who, despite having an assistantship, am considered below the poverty line. I’m a recovering drug user who has to pay out of pocket for my medication each month in order to keep myself clean (been clean for going on 7 years!!!). I spend most of my days taking care of my aunt, who’s currently suffering from stage 3 pelvic cancer. I’m also taking care of my father.

I could use some help. I’m not asking for donations, nor am I begging for coins. I just don’t know where to begin. I’m also offering my labor to anybody who might need assistance. CV can be provided.

The reason?I just got hit with a huge ER bill and an ambulance bill after having a seizure in class. The cause of the seizure was stress. I already have debt collectors coming after me from my last hospital visit from when I had pneumonia.

I’m not proud to be posting this, but am more than happy to provide personal information via DM, including SOLID proof of everything I mentioned.

I’m sorry if this violates terms and conditions I genuinely want to know about crypto and am seeking some assistance with the hopes that I can improve my current financial situation.

Tl;dr: taking care of a cancer patient (pelvic cancer), a stage 4 cancer survivor (squamous cell carcinoma), am being paid below the poverty line and give all of my money to take caring of family, mutual aid groups, etc. struggling with medical debt and issues and was told that learning about crypto be beneficial.

ALL PROOF CAN BE PROVIDED IN DM. EVERYTHING CAN BE CORROBORATED.

Recently (October 11-12,2021) I tried to SWAP about 0.8540 BTC TO USDT ON THE LEDGER WALLET NETWORK. It's not the first time i swap a coin to USDT on my ledger thru CHANGELLY from my ledger , I did it 4-5 months ago with ETH to USDT and everything went smooth because it was 200$ only lol not worth it for them to freeze it.

In this case , the BTC was sent to CHANGELLY wallet address and CONFIRMED on the blockchain network BUT my USDT swapped coins were put and still are ON HOLD. I sent an email to the security team @ CHANGELLY and they replied in less than an hour saying that my transaction was flagged and put on hold.

They said I needed to complete KYC procedures and Live Selfie thru a third-party website link in order to release my transaction/funds/coins. Personally, i don't mind doing the KYC steps so i did it right away after receiving their email to get this issue fixed.

I sent my personal information , my Driver's license and completed the Live Selfie step. Once i finished , the verification status was VERIFIED AND COMPLETED !

Then i received a second email from CHANGELLY saying they've received my documents and that we're almost done!

They also asked me to send proofs (receipts, screenshots or bank statement) that I own the coins which I  also did and sent every proof i could find since my BTC were bought
with FIAT CASH from a seller i know personally in my city. They asked me additional small questions and i always replied in less than 30 minutes because since this issue  I'm very worried and anxious about my money so I'm always refreshing my email for any new update .

Its been 1 Month already since the KYC was done and i still haven't got my transaction released or any update of my case with 
r/changelly

When i email them to ask for updates , they always reply with a similar copy/paste message saying that my case is being reviewed and that they will update me right away once its completed

So i started to search for reviews about their company on reddit and it seems many people had the same issue with them before but many refused to send their KYC info so they couldn't get their coins back. I did KYC , so why is it taking forever to complete my transaction ? 

i sent them multiples emails asking them to cancel the swap transactions or refund my 0.8540 BTC back in my LEDGER segwit, i haven't received any reply from them concerning my request they keep on ignoring me.

I'm very worried and anxious after reading different reviews  from different cases because I never had to wait that long for a crypto transaction. It looks like they want people to give up on their money because they will make you go thru hell and nightmare if you try to get your money back.

I need help from the bitcoin community this is unacceptable … imagine waiting for the ATH in the bullrun to cashout your profits and an exchange decides to freeze your funds without explanations and even after providing KYC documents.
